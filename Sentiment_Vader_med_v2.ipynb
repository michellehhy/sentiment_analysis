              " 'The number of adults seeking help to cope with an alcoholic parent has tripled over five years, according to a leading charity.\\nThe National Association for the Children of Alcoholics took more than 23,000 calls or messages last year from over 18s, compared to 6,400 in 2013.\\nExperts say more funding to support families and friends would help more people with alcoholic parents. \\nThe Department of Health said it was investing Â£6m to tackle the issue.\\n\\'My homeless dad\\'\\nAmelia and Joe Carr, from Newcastle, grew up with an alcoholic father. \\nHis drinking became very serious when Joe was 13 and Amelia was five. It continued up until his death two years ago. Towards the end of his life he was sleeping rough. \\n\"It was the thing I\\'d been dreading seeing, my own dad homeless on the street,\" Joe says.\\n\"I found him inebriated, as he always was, and dirty; sat in a doorway with a bottle. When I saw the state he was in all my anger evaporated and was replaced instead with pity.\"\\nChildren whose parents drink too much are said to be four times more likely to become dependent drinkers themselves. \\nJoe developed an issue with alcohol as an adult but he gave up completely when he became a father and is now teetotal. However, his ability to quit led to a new, very painful thought. \\n\"I can\\'t help but think if I could do that for my children why couldn\\'t he?\" he says.\\nJoe remembers the happy times before his father\\'s issues with alcohol started. But Amelia, eight years his junior, only remembers her father drinking. When he died she says in some ways she felt relieved. \\n\"Everyone around me was grieving for the man he was,\" she says, \"but I just couldn\\'t do that - I felt so guilty and confused.\"\\nThe drug and alcohol charity Addaction says approximately one in three older adults with an alcohol problem first develop it later in life. \\nA spokesman told 5 Live Investigates they would like to see more support and ease of access to services for people over the age of 50 with alcohol misuse issues. \\nThe National Association for the Children of Alcoholics (NACOA) supports those who have lived through childhood with their parent\\'s alcohol problems. They also offer help to people whose parent\\'s issues emerged in later life.\\nStephanie Page, a helpline supervisor at the the charity, said: \"The feelings of guilt have been born out of the anger and resentment towards their parent but they still love them so they feel guilty about feeling that sort of way towards them.\" \\nShe also said that people whose parents began drinking later tend to face a different set of challenges. \\n\"The parent may have retired and is lonely; they may have had issues adjusting to retirement. The adult child of the alcoholic often finds that really difficult because they haven\\'t seen this side of them before and they may not know what to do.\\n\"It can be really surreal seeing this side to your parent.\" \\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said it can be \"incredibly damaging for a young person to grow up with an alcoholic parent and can lead to lifelong harm\". \\n\"We are investing Â£6m to support children of dependent parents, and services including alcohol treatment and mental health services are available for people who are suffering the impact of parental drinking as adults.\"\\nThe spokesman said every person admitted to hospital showing signs of alcohol dependence in the 25% worst affected parts of the country will be offered \"targeted help to stop\". \\nYou can hear 5 Live Investigates at 11:00 GMT on Sunday 31 March and on BBC Sounds.',\n",
              " 'The current system of checking newborns for hip problems is failing, resulting in too many late diagnoses and corrective surgery, a study suggests.\\nAll newborns in England have their hips examined but only those at risk or with problems receive a scan.\\nSurgeons from Southampton Children\\'s Hospital said the rate of late diagnoses had not improved since screening started, over 30 years ago.\\nBut Public Health England said scanning all newborns could cause more problems. \\nDevelopmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH), if picked up early in babies, can be treated using a removable splint worn for two to three months.\\nBut if there is a delay in diagnosis of up to a year or more, untreated hip dysplasia can lead to a shortened leg, surgery and the risk of continuing hip pain and long-term complications.\\nAlexander Aarvold, study author and consultant orthopaedic surgeon at Southampton, said untreated hip dysplasia was \"a significant public health issue\" and the current approach had \"failed to impact\" on late diagnoses in children.\\n\"The signs are easily missed. They can be subtle,\" he said.\\n\"Doctors, midwives and nurses may be doing the checks and if they are not used to seeing hip dysplasia, it is hard to pick up.\"\\nThe research, by orthopaedic surgeons in The Bone and Joint Journal, looked at 754 cases of children diagnosed late with the hip problem - defined as after the age of one - between 1990 and 2016, a rate of 1.28 cases per 1,000 births.\\nBut UK studies before the hip screening programme began, in 1986, show the rate of late diagnoses then was only 0.88 per 1,000 births.\\nAnd smaller regional studies from the 1960s and 70s reveal even lower figures.\\nTim Theologis, president of the British Society for Children\\'s Orthopaedic Surgery, said: \"This study has provided evidence that the current selective screening for neonatal hip dysplasia is ineffective and the percentage of infants diagnosed late is unacceptably high.\"\\nOther countries, such as Germany and Austria, perform ultrasound scans of the hips of all newborns - and late diagnosis is extremely low there.\\nBut Prof Anne Mackie, director of screening at Public Health England, said: \"Offering a universal scan can cause more harm and evidence shows that it can lead to 20 times more babies being unnecessarily treated compared to the UK programme. \\n\"We know that wearing a splint in the crucial early months can affect the bond between mother and baby and can also cause avascular necrosis where the hip \\'dies\\'.\"\\nPHE said it was planning to introduce some changes to the screening process and looking at more training for clinicians carrying out the examinations.\\nIt\\'s a condition where the \"ball and socket\" joint of the hip does not form properly.\\nThis socket of the hip is too shallow and so the head of the thigh bone is not held tightly in place, making the hip joint loose. Sometimes, it can come out of the socket or dislocate\\nBabies\\' hips are checked as part of a physical examination within 72 hours of being born and again at six to eight weeks old.\\nThe examination involves gentle manipulation of a baby\\'s hip joints to check if there are any problems. \\nDDH is more common in girls than boys and more common in the left hip.\\nWithout treatment, DDH may lead to problems later in life, including:\\nWith early diagnosis and treatment, most children are able to develop normally and have a full range of movement in their hip.\\nSource: NHS UK',\n",

But it said it, \"works with every individual to design a package of care around them, to keep them safe and help them progress back to the community\".\\nATUs came under scrutiny in 2011 after the BBC\\'s Panorama exposed horrific abuse of patients at Winterbourne View.\\nThe government promised to end their use for those capable of living in the community with proper support through a programme called Transforming Care - which cost Â£10m. \\nDan Scorer, head of policy at Mencap, said: \"People are spending many, many years in there, they shouldn\\'t be. Awful things are happening to people in there and they shouldn\\'t be.\\n\"And in the same way asylums were closed, these places need to be closed and people need to be supported in the community.\"\\nNHS figures show an increase in staff resorting to medication, seclusion and even restraint when dealing with patients. Of the 2,500 incidents reported in December last year alone, 800 were against children under the age of 18.\\nLinda and Chris Hutchings\\' 27-year-old daughter lives in a secure unit in the East Midlands. She was sectioned, aged 14, after battling with an eating disorder and depression.\\nHer mum, Linda, says: \"I wake up in the middle of the night and I am crying because I am so sad.  \\n\"In one of the hospitals [not the one she is currently in] she was locked in one room for nine weeks, and it was so awful for her because there was nothing apart from a telly on a high bracket on the wall.\"\\nChris says: \"Can you even envisage another situation where a human being is locked up on the presumption of guilt? On what they might do to themselves or others? You lose that basic right to be free.\"\\nBirmingham City Council, which is responsible for their daughter\\'s care, also said it could not comment on individual cases, adding, \"there are always safeguarding measures in place when somebody\\'s liberty is limited due to illness or disability\".\\nExperts say the average placement cost of keeping one person in an ATU is more than Â£3,000 per week. \\nLabour\\'s shadow care minister, Barbara Keeley, said the government was allowing private companies to make millions, because the ATUs cost five times the amount of a community placement.\\n\"They are like the Bedlam institutions in Victorian times,\" she said. \"This is a hidden horror. There have been 40 deaths in these units in 2015, nine of those were people under 35.\"\\nShe said the government should make a new pledge to close them down.\\nA Department of Health spokesman said: \"We are determined to reduce the number of people on the autism spectrum with learning disabilities in mental health hospitals, and significant investment in community support has already led to a 20% reduction. \\n\"The NHS is committed to reducing inpatient numbers by 35% by 2020.\"\\nBut with the right support, some parents say that the government\\'s transformation care programme can work.\\nFauzia Hussain, who has Tourette\\'s and autism, spent 22 months in a secure unit. Her family says that she was prescribed high doses of medication, including anti-psychotic drugs and kept mostly in segregation. \\nSince she has left, her life has since been transformed. \\n\"It was a hopeless place.

on average by 5% according to a study in London - a limitation that cannot be reversed.\\nAnd air pollution can exacerbate other respiratory conditions too, including emphysema and chronic bronchitis, and lung cancer is thought to be linked as well. \\nDr Ben Barrett of King\\'s College London, who is running the backpack research, says that children born in a more polluted environment face greater challenges in life.\\n\"It\\'s not necessarily that there\\'s a particular disease that they develop but their body is less able to cope with those challenges as they go into adolescence and into old age.\"\\nAnother pathway to harm is opened up when the smallest particles find their way into the depths of the lungs, to the alveoli, from where oxygen is transferred into the bloodstream.\\nIt\\'s been established that PM2.5 particles are small enough to make that transition as well, entering the cardiovascular system and circulating throughout the body.\\nThe risks of this include the potential for blocking the arteries, increasing the danger of stroke, along with heart disease and heart attacks. \\nBeyond that, there\\'s evidence that the particles can reach the brain so researchers are investigating the potential effects on conditions such as dementia. \\nLondon\\'s dirty air: How bad is it?\\nMajor cities move to ban diesel vehicles \\nA major Chinese study last year proposed a connection between pollution and lowered cognitive performance, while a British study published last week suggested a link to psychotic episodes in teenagers. \\nAccording to Prof Jonathan Grigg of Queen Mary University London, a leading figure in research into the effects of air pollution on children, the evidence for wide-ranging impacts is growing.\\n\"We\\'re absolutely certain that air pollution is associated with respiratory disease such as asthma and with cardiovascular disease with heart attacks and strokes, and in five years we\\'ll be more certain about other conditions like dementia and obesity.\"\\nOne new area of research is the hunt for an explanation for why babies in the most polluted areas tend to be born more prematurely and underweight compared with those born elsewhere. \\nA small study, still under way, is investigating placentas and has found black dots that look similar to pollution particles spotted in lung cells. \\nOne of the researchers involved in the work, Norrice Liu, also at Queen Mary University, said the placenta would be expected to provide a sterile environment so the sight of black dots was a surprise. \\n\"We know what pollution particles look like when they\\'re in the cells elsewhere in the body particularly in the lungs, and the black bits that we\\'re seeing in the placenta are a very similar shape and colour to those what making us think they could be pollution particles.\"\\nTheir presence does not prove a link with premature birth or lower birthweight but it does suggest a possible mechanism.\\nFifteen young mothers have so far agreed to donate their placentas to the study, and one of them, Rachel Buswell, told me that of all her concerns while pregnant, air pollution was not one of them.\\n\"It\\'s pretty scary,\" she said, \"you protect yourself when you find out you\\'re pregnant in as many ways as you can and that\\'s going to be something people can\\'t protect themselves as easily, living in London especially, it is quite frightening.\"',\n",

But, in medicine, adverse events caused by left-right issues can have serious consequences. \\nA new study from Queen\\'s University Belfast has questioned the idea that determining left from right is effortless for everyone. \\nIt has said that medical education should respond by raising awareness about the challenges some medical students face.\\nIn addition to the many checks and balances in healthcare to prevent such errors, the study has also called for greater support to be extended in medical students training. \\nMr Ian Walsh is a surgeon and an academic at Queen\\'s. \\nWhile re-creating a simple investigation with a group of fourth-year medical students, he illustrates how left and right awareness come into play in everyday situations for medical professionals. \\nHe shows them an X-ray of a set of lungs - the left lung has fluid in it. \\nAs viewed straight on, the 2D X-rays appear to flip the left and right sides - in that a student will see the left-hand lung on the right side of the screen. \\nIt\\'s vitally important that the medical students are aware of this and also examine the patient themselves before they proceed to treat the patient by draining the lung.\\nThe new research paper, which is to be published in the journal Medical Education, was led by Prof Gerry Gormley from the Centre for Medical Education at Queens. \\nIt looked at how, for some of us, making left-right decisions is simple - but for others is it\\'s much more problematic. \\n\"In terms of spatial awareness, generally we don\\'t confuse above and below, behind and in front - but left and right can pose a challenge for some people. \\n\"It\\'s a relatively under-researched area and still there is a lot to be known about this particular topic. \\n\"We know that many individuals can, without thinking, determine the correct side.\\n\"However, for others they have to go through a complex process and use many higher functions to discriminate left from right.\"\\nSo this simple skill is actually more complex than it first appears - and it\\'s crucial those in medicine get it right. \\nDr Carl Brennan also worked on the research. He said that some students developed their own coping mechanisms. \\n\"One of the most common common ones can be with their hands - where on their left hand they form the \\'L\\' shape.\\n\"There are a number of others - wearing their wristwatch or wedding band on their left side or writing with their right.\"\\nQueens University is at the forefront of a field of study called Human Factors. \\nSimply put, in healthcare, it looks at how professionals best interact and behave with their environment, equipment and other people in the interests of patient safety. \\nIt can show medical professionals how best to communicate in teams and effectively handover increasingly complex information to others in healthcare. \\nMr Walsh explains its application to left-right issues. \\n\"This addresses beyond the more technical issues - for example where you mark the right limb to make sure you take off the correct limb, for example. \\n\"It looks at improving quality by looking at how we behave, how we think and how we interact.\"\\nProf Gormley said it\\'s important to translate this type of research into practice. \\n\"In our future simulation centre, in addition to what we are already doing we can bring students together with drama students, for example. \\n\"They can really re-create challenging situations but also the emotions and the situational awareness so that our medical students can convert their thoughts into correct actions to hopefully reduce error and deliver high quality care.\"',\n",

Up until 2017, the state maintained a decades-old ban on gay and lesbian foster parents.  \\nMrs Eledge said she fought, unsuccessfully, with her insurance company over health expenses that would have been covered if she was giving birth to her own child. And due to a law designating the person who delivers the baby as mother, Uma\\'s birth certificate lists Mrs Eledge alongside her son, and excludes Mr Dougherty.\\n\"This is just one small, micro example of the things that create road blocks for us,\" Mr Eledge said. \\nMr Eledge made headlines four years ago when he was dismissed from his job at Skutt Catholic High School after he informed school administrators that he and Mr Dougherty planned to get married. \\nMr Eledge\\'s treatment sparked outrage in his community, prompting parents and former and current students to create an online petition calling for an \"end to employment discrimination against Mr Eledge and future faculty\". \\nThe petition, now closed, garnered 102,995 supporters. \\nTypically a private family, Mrs Eledge says they chose to share their story to counter these examples of \"hate\" towards LGBT individuals and families, and convey \"that there\\'s always hope out there\". \\n\"I\\'m learning not to take it personally,\" said Mr Eledge of the negative responses to him and his family. \"At the end of the day, we have a family, we have friends, we have a huge community that supports us.\" \\nAnd week after Uma\\'s birth, Mrs Eledge says that she and her granddaughter are doing well.\\n\"This little girl is surrounded by so much support, she\\'s going to grow up in a loving family,\" Mrs Eledge said. \\n\"This was how it was meant to be.\"',\n",
              " 'US President Donald Trump has said he wants to wait until after the 2020 election to draft a new healthcare plan to replace the Affordable Care Act.\\nThe move reverses Mr Trump\\'s call last week to quickly scrap ex-President Obama\\'s signature law, which surprised some Republicans in Congress.\\nIt comes as the justice department backed a lawsuit aiming to strike down the healthcare law as unconstitutional.\\nAt least 20 million people could lose health coverage if the law is scrapped.\\nIt is unclear with what Republicans would replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, if the courts rule to abolish the law before the 2020 presidential election. \\nIn a series of tweets on Monday evening, Mr Trump wrote that a \"vote will be taken right after the Election when Republicans hold the Senate & win back the House\".\\nMany political pundits say that healthcare was a galvanising issue for Democrats, who won control of the House of Representatives, during the mid-term elections in 2018.\\nThe president\\'s decision comes a week after he called for an immediate replacement to the existing law, declaring the Republican Party would be \"the party of healthcare\". \\nMr Trump met Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill, some of whom later said the White House did not offer any plan for a new law during their talks.\\n\"Do we have a plan? What\\'s our plan?\" Alaska Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski said after their meeting.\\n\"He didn\\'t offer a plan,\" Senator Marco Rubio of Florida also said. \\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who is up for re-election in 2020, told reporters: \"I look forward to seeing what the president is proposing and what he can work out with the speaker.\"\\nThe announcement followed the Department of Justice decision to back a federal judge\\'s December ruling that found all of Obamacare unconstitutional.\\nThe move was seen as a dramatic reversal, as the White House had previously only called for stripping the law of some provisions.\\nOn Wednesday, former White House legislative affairs director Marc Short, who is currently working for Vice-President Mike Pence, told CNN that \"the president will be putting forward plans this year\" to replace Obamacare.\\nRepublicans had attempted to \"repeal and replace\" Obamacare on several occasions in 2017 when Mr Trump\\'s party controlled both chambers of Congress, but failed after Republicans were unable to reach a consensus over what law should replace it.\\nEliminating Obamacare has long been on the Republican party\\'s wishlist, and was a key campaign promise from Mr Trump.\\nAnalysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC Washington\\nFor six years Republicans promised their supporters that action on healthcare - full Obamacare repeal and a cheaper, better replacement - was just a winning election away. They needed to take the House, then the Senate, then the presidency. Then in 2016 they won - everything - and ran into a brick wall, as attempts at \"repeal and replace\" foundered.\\nNow, much to the dismay of congressional Republicans, Donald Trump wants to try again. First he signed his administration on to a long-shot lawsuit to get the entire Obamacare system invalidated. Then he announced that healthcare reform would be a priority for his party. \\nFor Republicans, this is a bridge too far. Memories of their 2018 mid-term defeats, in which Democrats ran on protecting Obamacare, are still fresh. The last thing they want is to refight those battles - with the added possibility of a court decision throwing the whole system into chaos.\\nPerhaps that\\'s why the president on Tuesday backed away from his promises of a new plan soon, instead announcing that an excellent, but still undefined, healthcare reform would be passed as soon as Republicans won total control of the government in 2020.\\nConservative healthcare reform is only an election away. Again.\\nSpeaking at a rally outside the Supreme Court on Tuesday, Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer told the crowd that Republicans will not have a healthcare proposal until 2021.\\n\"Translation: they have no health care plan. It\\'s the same old song they\\'ve been singing. They\\'re for repeal. They have no replace.\"\\n\"What a ruse. What a shame. What a disgrace... The American people will not stand for the president playing cynical games with health care,\" he continued.\\nTexas Republican Senator John Cornyn, the second highest ranking Republican in the chamber, said Mr Trump\\'s announcement does not remove the pressure on his party to come up with a replacement.\\n\"That\\'s one man\\'s timetable,\" he told the Washington Post. \"But I intend to continue to try to find ways to provide more affordable choices for people when it comes to their health care.\"\\nSouth Dakota Republican Senator John Thune said the decision was \"just probably a realistic assessment of what the field looks like for the next couple of years,\" in a reference to the Democrats\\' control of the House of Representatives.',\n",

And some he and Victoria have seen say they should not be administered if the child is allergic - but how would parents know?\\nProf Kampmann says the main allergy concern is some vaccines, such as MMR, contain traces of egg. \\n\"You know if you have a demonstrated egg allergy,\" she says. \\n\"You should be pointing that out. \\n\"And by the time the baby gets that particular vaccine, you would know if they did... or not because they would have had egg in all sorts of products.\"\\nDr Julian Spinks, of Court View medical practice, in Rochester, addresses another of the couple\\'s concerns - why GP surgeries are paid for each vaccination. \\n\"We\\'re just wondering whether GPs are pressurised to meet targets for financial gain?\" Mark says.\\nDr Spinks says they do have some targets but the money involved is relatively small. \\n\"The amount of money we get for a vaccine is about Â£10,\" he says.\\n\"By the time you\\'ve covered the costs we have, which is recording people, paying for nurses and people and so on, well over half of that is gone. \\n\"So actually, realistically, it\\'s a very small amount of money we get.\"\\nMark and Victoria are also worried the NHS may be too quick to offer vaccinations - without fully explaining potential risks.\\nDr Spinks says: \"I don\\'t think information is being suppressed as such [but] maybe people could get more.\\n\"One of the difficulties is that a lot of the anti-vaccination sites will raise very obscure things, which it would be impossible to cover in a short leaflet. \\n\"It doesn\\'t mean we won\\'t answer questions.\"\\nMark then asks: \"Why is it not fully explained to parents that immunisations are optional?\" \\nAnd Dr Spinks says he always tells parents they are voluntary, even though he would very strongly recommend them.\\n\"It ultimately is the parents\\' choice,\" he says, \"but I do have concerns because I do believe immunisation protects and it\\'s protecting your child and it\\'s also protecting the children around them, because of this thing of actually suppressing spread of the virus from one child to another.\"\\nMark and Victoria say meeting Prof Kampmann and Dr Spinks was \"enlightening and informative\".\\n\"We were pleased that the professionals could empathise,\" Mark says, \"and some felt there needed to be more info out there and training for health professionals. \\n\"Hopefully other parents now feel comfortable to come forwards.\"\\nFollow the BBC\\'s Victoria Derbyshire programme on Facebook and Twitter - and see more of our stories here.',\n",

As long as the high uptake continues, the virus has got nowhere to go and it is being eliminated. \\n\"We assessed 140,000 women in this study and because we can link status of vaccination to the disease its impact is indisputable.\"\\nLaura McAdam, 33, said she wishes the HPV vaccine had been available when she was at school. \\nIn 2016, she was diagnosed with cervical cancer after a routine smear test found changes in her cervix - despite having no symptoms.\\nLaura said she wished she had the opportunity to get the HPV vaccine at school.

If you are just popping out at lunchtime it is unlikely that you will need sunscreen, especially if you applied a moisturiser with SPF that morning or are in and out of the shade of buildings and trees.\\nThey are fine for offering some protection if you are going out briefly. But if you intend spending some time outdoors, especially between April and September, then sunscreens are much more effective. \\nMoisturisers providing SPF do not bind as well to the skin as sunscreen, and so are not intended to provide adequate protection for extended periods in the sun. \\nIn the winter months, UV protection in the UK is not necessary - except in people who are abnormally sensitive to sunlight. We all need some sun exposure, which provides us with important vitamin D.\\nHowever, this has to be balanced with the risk of skin damage in hotter months. This is not directly related to how hot it is, but to the UV index. \\nAlthough this is generally higher on cloudless, hot days than on cloudy, cool days, you should not rely on temperature alone as a guide to the need for sun protection.\\nSource: British Association of Dermatologists',\n",

It causes an unpleasant reaction and makes them feel unwell.\\nAs a result, there is a wide variation of alcohol intake in China - one in three men doesn\\'t drink and very few women do.\\nBut by comparing the health outcomes of drinkers and non-drinkers according to their genetic profile, scientists say they have been able to assess - with much more certainty than before - the direct effects of alcohol on stroke risk, distinct from any other factors.\\nWestern populations don\\'t possess these genes, so it would be impossible to carry out a similar study here.\\nAnd most studies are observational, which makes it\\'s difficult to judge which factor is causing what effect.\\nDr Iona Millwood, study author and senior epidemiologist at the University of Oxford, said: \"Our genetic analyses have helped us understand the cause and effect relationships.\"\\nThe researchers say their key message is that there is now clear evidence of no protective effect of moderate drinking on stroke.\\nThat means drinking even small amounts of alcohol each day can increase the chances of having a stroke.\\nThis is reflected in the current UK guidance - which advises a limit of 14 units of alcohol a week, with several alcohol-free days to keep health risks low.\\nDr Stephen Burgess, from the University of Cambridge, said there were some limitations to the study - that it only looked at a Chinese population and focused mainly on the drinking of spirits and beer, not wine.\\nBut he said the research reflected the culmination of many years of research into the impact of alcohol consumption. \\n\"It strongly suggests that there is no cardiovascular benefit of light drinking and that risk of stroke increases even with moderate light alcohol consumption,\" he said.\\n\"Risk of stroke increases proportionally with the amount of alcohol consumed, so if people do choose to drink, then they should limit their alcohol consumption.\" \\nProf Kevin McConway, emeritus professor of applied statistics at the Open University, said the study didn\\'t answer every question.\\n\"It has certainly advanced what we know about the role of alcohol in some diseases but it can\\'t be the last word,\" he said.\\n\"The new study doesn\\'t tie down exactly how alcohol works to increase stroke risk but doesn\\'t appear to increase heart attack risk.\" \\nProf David Spiegelhalter, Winton professor for the public understanding of risk, at the University of Cambridge, said the study was making him waver.\\n\"I have always been reasonably convinced that moderate alcohol consumption was protective for cardiovascular disease, but now I am having my doubts,\" he said.',\n",
              " 'Measles is one of the world\\'s most infectious illnesses but until recently cases had been declining. So what\\'s led to recent outbreaks?\\nRockland County, in New York state, declared a state of emergency following a severe re-emergence of the preventable virus. \\nIt\\'s far from an isolated case, with the US already on course this year to see the most measles cases since 2000, when the disease was officially eliminated.  \\nOther countries, such as Mexico, France and Madagascar, have seen similar outbreaks in communities with gaps in immunity.\\nIn most cases, measles is relatively minor but it can also lead to potentially life-threatening complications such as pneumonia, meningitis and brain inflammation.\\nAlthough still far below historical levels, the disease has been on the rise for several years. Reported cases rose by 31% in 2017 on the year before, leading to about 110,000 deaths worldwide.    \\nAccording to Unicef, 98 countries reported an increase in measles cases in 2018, with almost three-quarters of these occurring in 10 countries.  \\nSuccessful vaccination programmes have ensured measles has become rare in many places. \\nWhen a measles vaccine became widely used in the 1980s, cases fell significantly, eventually leading some countries to declare it had been eliminated.  \\nBefore then, large epidemics of measles occurred every few years. \\nFor example, in 1967, the year before measles vaccine was introduced in England and Wales, there were almost half a million reported cases and 99 deaths. By 1998, this had fallen to an all-time low of 56 cases and no deaths. \\nSo what accounts for the alarming recent increases?\\nA vaccination target of 95% creates \"herd immunity\" in a community, to prevent this highly infectious disease from spreading.\\nAll the measles outbreaks have taken hold in areas where there is not enough immunity but the reasons behind this differ from place to place. \\nThe high-profile anti-vaccination movement has become influential in parts of the US and Europe. \\nDespite overwhelming scientific evidence supporting vaccination, \"anti-vaxxers\" can believe vaccines are unnecessary or harmful. \\nThey sometimes embrace conspiracy theories around \"big pharma\" and are distrustful of government.  \\nIn the UK, a scare over the safety of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, following now discredited research, had a major impact for a time. \\nIn 2004, first-dose MMR coverage fell to 80% in England and 78% in Wales\\nTwo decades on, uptake has recovered, with over 90% of UK two-year-olds receiving the vaccine in 2017-18. \\nBut many adolescents and young adults not given the MMR as infants are now catching measles. \\nWe may also see future outbreaks of rubella - German measles - in this age group, a particular concern as they reach childbearing age. \\nUsually a mild disease, rubella can be catastrophic if caught in the early stages of pregnancy, causing serious vision, hearing, heart and learning problems in the unborn baby.\\nIn other countries, reasons behind falling vaccination rates are very different. \\nIn Ukraine, for example, public trust in vaccination was severely shaken in 2008, following the death of a teenager after a measles vaccination, which, although unconnected, led the government to halt the vaccination campaign. \\nBy 2016, in a situation made worse by political unrest, health service corruption and vaccine shortages, Ukraine had one of the lowest uptakes of measles vaccine in the world, with only one in three of six-year-old children protected with two doses of vaccine.  \\nAlthough over 90% of six-year-olds are now protected, the reservoir of young people left unprotected has allowed measles to take hold.\\nThe country has become a hotspot for measles, with 54,000 cases in 2018, compared with about 5,000 in the previous year.\\nImmunity levels have also fallen in countries where the health system has collapsed, such as Yemen, which is in the midst of civil war, and Venezuela, which tackling a serious economic crisis. \\nThis can have knock-on effects on other countries too, such as in Brazil, which has experienced mass migration from Venezuela.\\nSome countries are moving toward mandatory vaccination and many more have tightened up existing requirements. \\nItaly and France have extended existing requirements with fines and restricted school attendance. And Germany is currently discussing making measles vaccine mandatory.  \\nIn New York\\'s Rockland County, unvaccinated children have been banned from public places for 30 days. But it is difficult to see how this could be effectively enforced and there is little evidence that mandatory vaccination is always the best approach. \\nThose determined to not vaccinate will find a way round the system, for example by home-schooling or paying a fine.  \\nMeanwhile, parents on the fence about vaccination may become more resistant if they feel they are not being given a choice. A better solution may be the opportunity to have a conversation with a health professional to respond to their concerns.\\nMore like this\\nMeanwhile, checking vaccination status on entry to nursery and then to school would act as a useful reminder to parents and reinforce their importance.\\nAs most under-immunisation results from difficulties accessing services, tailored immunisation services would also be helpful. \\nFor example, an innovative response to a measles outbreak in the London borough of Hackney was the \"spotty bus\" - a mobile immunisation unit that toured the neighbourhood, parking in school playgrounds and supermarket car parks, vaccinating almost 1,000 children whose parents simply needed easier access to immunisation services.\\nIt is not enough for health services to expect parents to come to them.\\nTaking a proactive approach and offering these kinds of easily accessible vaccine programmes would help to prevent further outbreaks. \\nSince the global fall in vaccination rates mainly stems from practical or logistical issues, it is often more important to have an everything in place for a successful vaccination programme. \\nThis means having enough vaccines to go around, via services that are well organised, easy to access and supported by government efforts to increase public trust in vaccination. \\nAbout this piece\\nThis analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from an expert working for an outside organisation.\\nHelen Bedford is a professor of children\\'s health at University College London.\\nYou can follow her on Twitter here.\\nEdited by Eleanor Lawrie',\n",

At the moment drugs like chemotherapy cause damage throughout the body. \\nOne of the researchers is Dr Fiona Behan, whose mother died after getting cancer for the second time. \\nThe first course of chemotherapy damaged her mother\\'s heart, so she was not physically strong enough for many treatments the second time around.\\nDr Behan told the BBC: \"This is so important because currently we treat cancer by treating the entire patient\\'s body. We don\\'t target the cancer cells specifically.\\n\"The information we have uncovered in this study has identified key weak-spots of the cancer cells, and will allow us to develop drugs that target the cancer and leave the healthy tissue undamaged.\" \\nCancer is caused by mutations inside our body\\'s own cells that change the instructions written into our DNA. \\nMutations corrupt cells leading to them growing uncontrollably, spreading around the body and eventually killing people.\\nThe researchers embarked on a gargantuan feat of disabling each genetic instruction - called a gene - inside cancers, to see which were crucial for survival.\\nThey disrupted nearly 20,000 genes in more than 300 lab-grown tumours made from 30 different types of cancer. \\nThey used a tool called Crispr - the same genetic technology that was used to re-engineer two babies in China last year.\\nIt is a relatively new, easy and cheap tool for manipulating DNA, and this study would have been an impossible feat just a decade ago.\\nThe results, published in the journal Nature, revealed 6,000 crucial genes which at least one type of cancer needs to survive. \\nSome were unsuitable for developing cancer drugs, as they are also essential in healthy cells. \\nOthers are already the target of precision drugs like Herceptin in breast cancer - the team called this a \"sanity check\" that proves their method works.\\nAnd yet more are beyond current science to develop suitable drugs, so the researchers narrowed down a shortlist of 600 potential new targets for drugs to attack.\\nOne potential target is \"Werner syndrome RecQ helicase\" also known more simply as WRN.\\nThe research team found it was essential for keeping some of the most genetically unstable cancers alive. \\nWRN plays a vital role in around 15% of colon cancers and 28% of stomach cancers, but there are no drugs that target it. \\nThe work was a collaboration between Sanger, the European Molecular Biology Laboratory and pharmaceutical giant GSK.

And do they even work? \\nLast month, a 51-year-old woman from Hunan, China, nearly died after blending 20 different fruits to create a homemade intravenous (IV) drip. She thought vitamins from the fresh fruit would benefit her health. \\nInstead, she developed a fever and itchiness, and was taken into intensive care with multiple organ damage. After dialysis, and several rounds of antibiotics, she is now recovering. \\nThis is an extreme example, but she may have been inspired by the growing trend for IV in which vitamins and other substances are administered directly into the blood. \\nThe practice is very popular in Asia where IV drips are offered in beauty salons, often by unlicensed and unqualified practitioners. \\nThose promoting vitamin IV drips claim they can boost energy, strengthen the immune system, improve skin, cure hangovers, burn fat, fight jet lag, and cure a myriad of other minor ailments. \\nIn the US, a bus will even come to your house to offer infusions as part of a party package, to \"cure\" hangovers. \\nTreatments can be very expensive, costing anything from Â£120 to Â£3,000 in one London clinic. \\nCelebrities such as Miley Cyrus, Cara Delevingne and Chrissy Teigen have taken part in the growing trend, posting images of themselves on social media hooked up to IV bags. \\n\"The treatments are increasingly popular, particularly as a quick fix or hangover cure - but there is no evidence of benefits and they can potentially be dangerous,\" says Marcela Fiuza, from the British Dietetic Association.\\n\"Within a medical setting, we would never infuse anything intravenously, unless we absolutely had to,\" says Sophie Medlin, who used to work as a clinical dietitian and as a lecturer in nutrition and dietetics at King\\'s College London. \\n\"There is simply no medical justification for administering nutrition intravenously in any case other than intestinal failure, because it is so high risk.\"\\nTypically, in a medical setting, a patient who has anything injected intravenously would have a thorough medical history taken.\\nInfusion of vitamins potentially puts the liver and kidneys under stress, and to go ahead without screening the liver and kidney function first is prohibited by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the UK. \\n\"That kind of provision is not being taken in most of the clinics I\\'ve seen practising intravenous vitamin drips,\" says Ms Medlin.\\nWhat is in the bag of fluid varies around the world. In Taipei, customers can receive a menu to choose what kind of vitamins they want to include. \\nIn New Delhi, customers can pick between drips called \"Basic\" or \"Thirsty\" if for hydration, or treatments for skin called \"Woke\" or \"Lit\". \\nThere is even a drip named \"Magic Markle\" after the Duchess of Sussex.  In London, along with detox and beauty drips, one outlet offers mood boosts.\\nTo boost their chances in university entrance exams, high school students in Hubei, China, were photographed hooking themselves up to intravenous vitamin drips.\\nThe image went viral, and the school claimed that the students had volunteered to take amino acids. As the school\\'s infirmary became too full with the demand, the students took the IVs to the classroom where they could continue to study.\\nMs Medlin is shocked by this - she says that IVs should never be administered outside a carefully-controlled clinical environment. \\n\"Any time you put anything into your body intravenously, you\\'re running the risk of infection from the site where it\\'s entered your bloodstream,\" she says. \\nAnd why risk possible infection when our gut is excellent at absorbing the vitamins and minerals we need?   \\nFor most people, a healthy balanced diet (and in some cases an oral vitamin supplement) is sufficient to provide all vitamins you need, says Ms Fuiza. \\nUsing IV drips mean that \"people could be unknowingly receiving excessive amounts of nutrients which may have health implications, particularly for those having it regularly and people with background health conditions (known or unknown)\", she warns. \\nCertain groups at risk of deficiencies should use supplements: \\nSource: NHS Choices: Supplements, who needs them? \\nLisa Rogers, from the World Health Organization, thinks that people are being overzealous in their ingestion of extra vitamins.\\n\"They think that it will give them a certain advantage. People only need vitamins in tiny amounts and only in the case of having a deficiency is it worth considering taking extra supplements,\" she says.\\nForce-feeding vitamins into the veins via a drip could even put people at risk of a potential overdose, warns Ms Medlin.\\n\"IV drips push vitamins into our bloodstream in a force-fed way. We will probably just excrete at least 90% of what\\'s being infused in, so actually the benefits are very minimal, if any at all, and the risks massively outweigh the benefits,\" she says.\\nEven if no complications arise from injecting the vitamin drips, Ms Medlin says that ultimately, \"You are just making very expensive urine.

It might not work for everyone but we\\'ve been incredibly lucky.\"\\nElouise is on antibiotics \"as a precaution\", her mum said, but \"her baseline is so good the doctor hopes the effects of spina bifida will be minimal\".\\n\"We hope she will learn to walk and talk like a normal baby,\" she added.\\nMrs Simpson\\'s surgery was funded by a charitable trust set up by the hospital which carried out her surgery and Great Ormond Street. But NHS England has confirmed that spinal surgery for unborn babies with spina bifida will soon be routinely available.\\nMrs Simpson is thought to be the fourth patient to undergo the surgery in the UK, with the procedure mostly carried out in Belgium and the United States.\\nSpina bifida literally means \\'split spine\\', and occurs when the spinal column and cord are not properly formed in pregnancy (before the sixth week) - leaving nerves exposed.\\nIt occurs in around four in 10,000 pregnancies.\\nThe cause is unknown, however mothers are encouraged to take folic acid supplements to reduce the risk of developing spina bifida in early pregnancy. \\nBabies born with the condition can become paralysed, suffer bladder and bowel problems - and it can affect brain development.\\nIt is estimated that about 80% of mothers choose termination when spina bifida is diagnosed, although the condition varies in severity.\\nThe delicate surgical procedure involves opening the uterus and closing the gap in the baby\\'s back while they are still in the womb.',\n",
              " 'Cholesterol-lowering \"statin\" drugs taken by millions of Britons may not work well enough in about half of those prescribed them, research suggests. \\nUK investigators looked at 165,000 patients on statins and found that for one in two, the drugs had too little effect on bad cholesterol - one of the big risk factors for heart disease. \\nThey are not sure why statins appear to help some more than others. \\nPatients should not stop taking the drugs without seeing their doctor.\\nOne possible explanation is patients not taking their prescribed drugs or doctors giving them at too low doses, experts suggest.\\nCardiovascular disease kills about 150,000 people in the UK each year.\\n\"Bad\" low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is a major contributor - it can lead to furring and blockage of blood vessels.\\nCutting down on saturated fat can help lower bad cholesterol, but some people will also need medication. Millions of people in the UK are given statins for this reason. \\nBut statins can cause side effects and there is a debate about how many patients should be prescribed them.\\nThe study, published in the journal Heart, included 165,411 patients who had been put on statins to cut their risk of developing heart disease by lowering their cholesterol to a healthy level. \\nHalf of the patients - 84,609 in total - did not see their cholesterol go down by enough - the required 40% or more reduction specified by guidelines - even after being on the daily treatment for two years. \\nExperts say the study findings are somewhat limited because they cannot prove that patients who do not respond well to statins will necessarily fare worse as a consequence. Other factors - like smoking and obesity - also raise cardiovascular risk. \\nBut the work does provide \"real life\" data and experience to draw on.\\nResearcher Dr Stephen Weng, from Nottingham University, said: \"Our research has shown that in almost half of patients prescribed statins, they are very effective and offer significant protection against cardiovascular disease. \\n\"However, for the other half - whether it\\'s due to your genetic make-up, having side effects, sticking to the treatment or other medications - we don\\'t see that intended benefit.\"\\nIn the study, a higher proportion of patients with a sub-optimal response to statins were prescribed lower potency doses, compared with those with an optimal response.\\nHe said: \"We have to develop better ways to understand differences between patients and how we can tailor more effective treatment for those millions of patients who are simply blanket-prescribed statins.\"\\nProf Metin Avkiran, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, advised: \"Statins are an important and proven treatment for lowering cholesterol and reducing the risk of a potentially fatal heart attack or stroke.   \\n\"If you have been prescribed statins, you should continue to take them regularly, as prescribed. If you have any concerns you should discuss your medication with your GP. There are now other drugs available to help lower cholesterol levels, and it may be that another type of medication will be an effective addition or alternative for you.\"\\nProf Helen Stokes-Lampard, chairwoman of the Royal College of GPs, said: \"When we prescribe medication, we have to rely on patients to make sure that they take it, both at the recommended dose and for the duration of time that we think will benefit them most.\\n\"There is a substantial body of research showing that statins are safe and effective drugs for most people, and can reduce the risk of heart attacks and stroke, when prescribed appropriately - but controversy remains around their widespread use and their potential side-effects.\\n\"There are complex reasons why patients choose not to take their prescribed medication, and mixed messaging around statins could be one of these.\"',\n",

German Chancellor Angela Merkel has made similar claims, and swapping hours in bed for extra time in the office is not uncommon in tales of business or entrepreneurial success. \\nYet the researchers said the belief that less than five hours\\' shut-eye was healthy, was one of the most damaging myths to health.\\n\"We have extensive evidence to show sleeping five hours or less consistently, increases your risk greatly for adverse health consequences,\" said researcher Dr Rebecca Robbins.\\nThese included cardiovascular diseases, such as heart attacks and strokes, and shorter life expectancy. \\nInstead, she recommends everyone should aim for a consistent seven to eight hours of sleep a night.\\nThatcher: Can people get by on four hours\\' sleep?\\nThe relaxing nightcap is a myth, says the team, whether it\\'s a glass of wine, a dram of whisky or a bottle of beer. \\n\"It may help you fall asleep, but it dramatically reduces the quality of your rest that night,\" said Dr Robbins.\\nIt particularly disrupts your REM (rapid eye movement) stage of sleep, which is important for memory and learning.\\nSo yes, you will have slept and may have nodded off more easily, but some of the benefits of sleep are lost.\\nAlcohol is also a diuretic, so you may find yourself having to deal with a full bladder in the middle of the night too. \\nHave you ever thought \"I need to wind down before bed, I\\'m going to watch some TV\"?\\nWell, the latest Brexit twists and turns on the BBC News at Ten might be bad for sleep.\\nDr Robbins argues: \"Often if we\\'re watching the television it\\'s the nightly newsâ\\x80¦ it\\'s something that\\'s going to cause you insomnia or stress right before bed when we\\'re trying to power down and relax.\"\\nAnd as for Game of Thrones, it\\'s hard to argue the Red Wedding was relaxing. \\nThe other issue with TV - along with smartphones and tablets - is they produce blue light, which can delay the body\\'s production of the sleep hormone melatonin. \\nWill the light from your phone kill you?\\nYou\\'ve spent so long trying to nod off you\\'ve managed to count all the sheep in New Zealand (that\\'s about 28 million).\\nSo what should you do next? The answer is not to keep trying. \\n\"We start to associate our bed with insomnia,\" said Dr Robbins.\\n\"It does take the healthy sleeper about 15 minutes to fall asleep, but much longer than thatâ\\x80¦ make sure to get out of bed, change the environment and do something that\\'s mindless.\"\\nHer tip - go fold some socks. \\nWho isn\\'t guilty of reaching for the snooze button on their phone, thinking that extra six minutes in bed is going to make all the difference?\\nBut the research team says that when the alarm goes off, we should just get up.\\nDr Robbins said: \"Realise you will be a bit groggy - all of us are - but resist the temptation to snooze.\\n\"Your body will go back to sleep, but it will be very light, low-quality sleep.\"\\nInstead the advice is to throw open the curtains and expose yourself to as much bright light as possible.\\nSnoring can be harmless, but it can also be a sign of the disorder sleep apnoea. \\nThis causes the walls of the throat to relax and narrow during sleep, and can briefly stop people breathing. \\nPeople with the condition are more likely to develop high blood pressure, an irregular heartbeat and have a heart attack or a stroke. \\nOne of the warning signs is loud snoring. \\nNHS: Obstructive sleep apnoea\\nDr Robbins concludes: \"Sleep is one of the most important things we can all do tonight to improve our health, our mood, our wellbeing and our longevity.\"  \\nFollow James on Twitter',\n",

Instead the couple became part of a kidney swap chain, which is allowing more people to find live donors.\\nMandy first needed a kidney transplant about 19 years ago.\\nBecause her husband was not compatible, Mandy had to wait until a suitable donation became available from a deceased donor. \\nShe considers herself lucky to have got a phone call in the middle of the night and been rushed to hospital to receive the donor kidney.\\nMany people are not so fortunate. Last year, 26 people in Scotland died while waiting for a kidney transplant.\\nWhen a person needs a new kidney they first turn to family and friends to find a living donor.\\nDoctors says patients who have a living kidney transplant tend to live longer and feel better than those who receive kidneys from a deceased donor.  \\nMandy\\'s new kidney allowed her to function for 18 years but it has recently started to decline and she was told she would need another transplant.\\nHer husband Graham was tested again but was still not a match.\\nHowever, Mandy\\'s consultant told her about the UK Living Kidney Sharing Scheme, which has been running for more than a decade.\\n\"It is where couples like us can be paired up and help each other out,\" says Mandy.\\n\"My brilliant husband didn\\'t hesitate for a moment. \\n\"I tried desperately to talk him out of it but he was having none of it.\"\\nThe kidney sharing scheme uses an algorithm designed at Glasgow University.\\nIt goes through everyone who has volunteered and tries to find better matches and maximise the number of possible transplants.\\nThe computer programme is run four times a year and the transplants are then scheduled by a dedicated coordinator.\\nIt is a logistical challenge, according to Sarah Lundie, the coordinator at Edinburgh\\'s Royal Infirmary.\\nIn order for even the simplest kidney swap to go ahead you need two healthy donors and two recipients who are also not suffering from any illnesses. \\nIf any one of them gets so much as a cold, the whole carefully arranged schedule must be cancelled.\\nMs Lundie must also make sure that there are operating theatres booked at both locations and four surgeons must be available to carry out the procedures, not to mention their extensive back-up teams.\\nThere is also a great deal of liaison going on to ensure that the organs are transported from the donors to the recipients at the same time. \\nAs he sat in Edinburgh waiting to donate his kidney, Graham Murray, 53, was aware that there was someone in Belfast, who must remain anonymous, waiting to give up a kidney so that it could be donated to Mandy.\\nGraham says: \"Getting to this morning with everyone fit and healthy and ready to go is a great relief.\"\\nHis wife Mandy, 57, says they have felt the \"responsibility\" of keeping well in the weeks before the operations so that the donor sharing chain would not be broken.\\nShe says: \"Graham and I decided to sequester ourselves in our house, get our shopping delivered and really try not to catch anything so we could make sure that bond could be maintained.\" \\nGraham and his counterpart in Belfast are the first part of the surgical equation.\\nBoth donor kidneys are removed simultaneously in the two locations.\\nIn Edinburgh, consultant transplant surgeon John Terrace scrubs up for an operation he says usually takes about three hours.\\n\"I\\'m thinking about the donor rather than the recipient,\" he says. \\n\"The focus with donors is operating safely and meticulously. The risk to donors is actually very small.\"\\nMr Terrace says he uses a modified form of keyhole surgery to remove the kidney.\\nHe uses laparoscopy to see but also has his hand inside the patient. \\n\"That offers an extra element of control and safety,\" Mr Terrace says. \\n\"The first 80% is moving things out of the way, moving the liver and the bowel and identifying the kidney and the structures that go into it and come out - the vein, the artery and ureter.\"\\nHe says these are then prepared so the kidney can be removed quickly but still be suitable for \"reimplantation\" into the recipient. \\nOnce the kidney is removed it is quickly on its way.\\nIn this case, the organs leave Edinburgh and Belfast on chartered flights, arriving in time for the donation surgery to happen in the afternoon.\\nMandy\\'s kidney surgery is performed by consultant Sorina Cornateanu.\\nShe uses blood vessels going to the leg to help attach the new kidney.\\nThen the blood supply is returned and the kidney turns pink and perfused.\\nOften the kidney passes urine on the operating table.\\nThe surgery takes about three hours and the patient is immediately started on anti-rejection drugs and goes into a high-dependency unit.\\nAfter successfully operating on Mandy, Ms Cornateanu describes her team as the \"vehicles\" between the donor and the recipient.\\n\"That\\'s our role. It is fulfilling, rewarding, humbling and it is a big relief at this stage.\"\\nMs Cornateanu said the shared donor scheme had been a big success and even in the past year the number of live donor transplants had risen in Edinburgh by half to 14.\\n\"It has been a big team effort from all of us and we need to sustain that. That\\'s the challenge.\"\\nAcross Scotland, 50 kidney sharing scheme transplants have taken place in the past five years.\\nIt is more common for living donor transplants to involve a relative or friend who is a close match but this is not always possible.\\nAnother form of living donation is \"altruistic\". Over the past 10 years, 78 people in Scotland have donated a kidney to a stranger.\\nThe day after their operations, Mandy and Graham were told the other donor and recipient in the chain were doing well.\\nGraham said: \"That\\'s fantastic. We never expected to know.\"\\n\"I\\'m so pleased,\" said Mandy.\\nThe pair hope they will soon be recovered enough to fulfil all the plans they have had to put on hold until now.',\n",

              " 'Even small amounts of red and processed meat - such as a rasher of bacon a day - can increase the risk of bowel cancer, according to research.  \\nThe latest study led by Oxford University and funded by Cancer Research UK, adds to evidence, including from the World Health Organization, that eating red meat can be harmful. \\nBut exactly how big is the risk? And how much is too much? \\nHere\\'s what you need to know. \\nResearchers analysed data from almost half a million people involved in the UK Biobank study. \\nOver the six years of their study they found 2,609 people developed bowel cancer. \\nThey estimate:\\nAccording to the NHS, 76g of cooked red meat is equivalent to about half an 8oz sirloin steak. A slice of ham or rasher of bacon is about 23g of processed meat. \\nIt\\'s not clear. Cancer Research UK (CRUK) says 5,400 of the 41,804 cases of bowel cancer seen each year in the UK could be prevented if people did not eat processed meat at all. \\nAccording to Emma Shields, information manager at CRUK,  \"This study shows the more meat you eat, the higher your risk of getting cancer and obviously the reverse is true - the less you eat the less likely you are to get bowel cancer,\" \\nBut she acknowledges smoking poses a much bigger risk, causing 54,300 cases of cancer each year. \\nPublic Health England says from its surveys many people eat too much red and processed meat. \\nAnd experts advise people who eat lots of it to find ways to cut down. \\nThe Department of Health advises anyone eating more than 90g a day of red and processed meat should cut down to 70g. \\nNHS guidance says there are some benefits of red meat - iron and protein content, for example - that must be balanced against potential risks. \\nPeople can still eat meat and be healthy.\\nProcessed meat - including bacon, some sausages, hot dogs, salami - is modified to either extend its shelf-life or change the taste - the main methods are smoking, curing, or adding salt or preservatives.\\nIt is thought the chemicals involved in the processing could be increasing the risk of cancer. High temperature cooking, such as on a barbecue, can also create carcinogenic chemicals.\\nWhen it comes to red meat like beef, lamb and pork, there are suggestions that one of the proteins (that gives it its red colour) can damage the gut when it is broken down. \\nBut experts are still trying to fully understand the link. \\nProf Gunter Kuhnle, at the University of Reading, described the study as a very thorough analysis of the link between meat intake and bowel (also known as colorectal) cancer.\\nHe said: \"The results confirm previous findings that both, red and processed meat consumption, increase the risk of colorectal cancer. \\n\"The increase in risk of approximately 20% per 50g increase of red and processed meat intake is in line with what has been reported previously, and confirms these findings. \\n\"The study also shows that dietary fibre reduces the risk of colorectal cancer. An increased consumption of fibre, as shown by this study, would be of considerably more benefit.\"\\nCarrie Ruxton, of the Meat Advisory Panel, an industry-funded body, said: \"Red meat provides valuable nutrients, such as protein, iron, zinc, vitamin D and B vitamins.\"\\nShe said it was known that \"a range of lifestyle factors have a significant impact on the risk of bowel cancer, most notably age, genetics, lack of dietary fibre, inactivity and high alcohol consumption\". \\nThe study is published in the International Journal of Epidemiology.',\n",

There\\'s a drug that would allow her to eat like anyone else - she took it for three years during a clinical trial. But the NHS won\\'t pay for it, reports the BBC\\'s Deborah Cohen - and the drug company stopped giving it to her once the trial was over.\\nImagine having to take more than 80 pills a day or drink shakes to replace everyday foods you can\\'t eat. That\\'s the reality for Louise Moorhouse, a 35-year-old teacher from Birmingham, who has a rare genetic condition called phenylketonuria or PKU.\\nThe pills are \"huge\", she says.\\n\"They\\'re quite tricky to swallow. I think the most I have managed to do in one go is four. Any more than that and they come out my nose.\"\\nThe shakes are preferable, but attempts to give them a fruity taste have not succeeded in masking their \"stomach-turning\" acidity. From time to time her stomach starts to reject them, Louise says. In which case, she goes back on the pills.\\nPeople with PKU can\\'t properly digest the amino acid phenylalanine. Amino acids are the building blocks of protein and are broken down by the body to make our own proteins. But in people with PKU the levels build up, and can cause brain damage.\\nLouise says she has to completely avoid 80% of normal food, and the protein in her diet has to be severely restricted - which may mean weighing it on scales before eating it.\\n\"I basically live on fruits and vegetables,\" she says.\\nDinner dates are best avoided, she has learned.\\n\"I avoid socialising with food if there\\'s people there who I don\\'t know,\" Louise says. \"They may notice that sometimes I have to get my scales out and sometimes I have to send food back or it takes me a long time to choose food.\"\\nBut for three years, in her early 20s, Louise was able to eat like anyone else.\\nThat\\'s because she took part in trials for a drug now called Kuvan (sapropterin hydrochloride) that was being developed by US biotech company, BioMarin.\\nWatch Deborah Cohen\\'s report on Louise Moorhouse for Newsnight\\n\"I took part in the trial because I just thought, \\'Wow, if this works it\\'s just going to change lives,\\'\" she says.\\nAnd for Louise it did. \\n\"Kuvan allowed me to eat a completely normal diet. And it was it was almost like someone had opened curtains on my life and I could see everything in Technicolor,\" she says. \"It just freed me up so much.\"\\nThe dietician who had treated Louise as a child, Prof Anita MacDonald of Birmingham Children\\'s Hospital, was one of the scientists involved. With help from her and Louise, BioMarin gathered enough evidence to show Kuvan reduced the levels of phenylalanine in many people with PKU. In 2007, it became the only licensed drug for the condition in the US; its European licence followed in 2008.\\n\"Because the trial had gone so well and because it made such a difference, I was convinced that it would only be a matter of time before this drug - that we had proved worked - would be available to everyone who responded to it,\" Louise says.\\nBut for NHS patients it wasn\\'t. BioMarin put a Â£70,000 price tag on it, per adult per year - and the NHS thought it wasn\\'t worth that. \\n\"The drug was too expensive and the NHS decided that there wasn\\'t enough evidence of efficacy of that drug at that time and so they said no to prescribing it,\" says Anita MacDonald. \\nIt was a blow for Louise, who had to return to the pills and shakes. \\n\"It was a massive shock to my system,\" she says. \"I had to relearn almost everything. It had a massive effect on my concentration, my mood, my focus at work, my relationship.\"\\nThe hope of an effective treatment for PKU had appeared on the horizon in the 1990s. A simple compound developed in a Swiss laboratory had been found to enable people with PKU to digest phenylalanine. It was then researched with public money and used unlicensed by many doctors.\\nThe trouble was, PKU is quite a rare disease. In England it is estimated that between one in 10,000 and one in 14,000 people have PKU. So there was little financial incentive for a pharmaceutical company to turn the compound into a licensed drug.\\nThen in 2000, the European Commission introduced incentives to encourage the production of \"orphan drugs\" for people with rare conditions, ruling that companies would enjoy up to 12 years of market exclusivity.\\nAccording to Dyfrig Hughes, professor of pharmacoeconomics at Bangor University, more than 165 orphan drugs have now been approved - and that in fact 50% of all drugs approved last year were for rare diseases. Companies find them profitable. \\nBut critics say the profitability - and the high price - of orphan drugs does not reflect the amount of effort companies have had to make to generate them. \\n\"We did one piece of work where we identified that 40% of orphan drugs are actually repurposed. That is they\\'ve been previously used for other purposes before they were granted orphan status,\" Dyfrig Hughes says. \\nWith governments across Europe struggling with the price of drugs used to treat rare conditions, the BBC is aware that the European Commission is reviewing the incentives scheme. \\nIn 2004, BioMarin - which specialises in drugs for rare conditions - bought the data from the early development of the compound to treat PKU. This meant that while it had to fund trials it didn\\'t have to meet the costs of searching for an entirely novel chemical compound. \\nWhen Kuvan was licensed a few years later and the NHS refused to pay the hefty price, patients were stuck in the middle. This remains the case, even now that the NHS has come to recognise the efficacy of the drug.\\n\"BioMarin have been asked to drop the price on many occasions but at the moment they have a patent,\" Anita Macdonald says. \"They\\'ve got no competition.\"\\nBioMarin told the BBC the NHS has asked for an 80% discount. \\n\"BioMarin is disappointed that the NHS England has not recognised the value of treating PKU patients with Kuvan, despite more than a decade of positive patient outcomes across 26 countries in Europe, Russia and Turkey,\" a spokesperson said. \\nAn NHS England spokesperson said: \"The NHS does not offer a blank cheque to pharmaceutical companies, instead the NHS works hard to strike deals which give people access to the most clinically effective and innovative medicines, and at a price which is fair and affordable, which is exactly what our patients and the country\\'s taxpayers would expect us to do.\"\\nMost disappointed by the outcome were the people like Louise, who had taken part in the trial and identified Kuvan as what Louise calls \"the holy grail for us\". The BBC is aware of seven others.\\n\"You want your patients to gain any benefit from the work that they\\'ve done. They\\'ve entered the trial in good heart. We as scientists enter the trial in good heart,\" says Anita Macdonald.\\n\"I don\\'t think it is ethical for patients to be involved in a trial and not continue with a treatment. Those patients put a lot of trust in the drug company and it\\'s the least that could have been done for them to continue with that treatment longer term.\" \\nIndeed, there is a global medical ethics agreement for research, called the Declaration of Helsinki, which says provisions should be made \"for all participants who still need an intervention identified as beneficial in the trial\". \\nWhen the BBC pointed this out to BioMarin, the company said: \"To the best of our knowledge, BioMarin is treating all known ex-trial patients. If there are any ex-trial patients who are not being treated and would like to be treated, they should talk to their treating physician and apply for treatment.\"  \\nFor Louise, who for 10 years since the end of the trial has had to maintain her diet of pills or shakes, this came as startling news. She burst into tears. \\nIt had taken her years to conceive because of the difficulty getting her blood levels of phenylalanine down, she said.\\n\"A lot has happened that didn\\'t have to happen. All these years I could have been on Kuvan and I wouldn\\'t have had so many issues.\\n\"I feel so emotional - it\\'s like winning the lottery.\"\\nUpdate 1 November 2019:Louise Moorhouse has now been receiving Kuvan for several months.\\nBritish teenager Shauna Davison was given an experimental transplant in 2012, in the hope of prolonging her life.

              " 'US scientists have partially revived pig brains four hours after the animals were slaughtered. \\nThe findings could fuel debate about the barrier between life and death, and provide a new way of researching diseases like Alzheimer\\'s.\\nThe study showed the death of brain cells could be halted and that some connections in the brain were restored. \\nHowever, there were no signals from the brain that would indicate awareness or consciousness. \\nThe surprise findings challenge the idea that the brain goes into irreversible decline within minutes of the blood supply being cut off. \\nThirty-two pig brains were collected from an abattoir. \\nFour hours later the organs were connected to a system made by the team at Yale University. \\nIt rhythmically pumped (to mimic the pulse) a specially designed liquid round the brain, which contained a synthetic blood to carry oxygen and drugs to slow or reverse the death of brain cells.  \\nThe pig brains were given the restorative cocktail for six hours. \\nThe study, published in the journal Nature, showed a reduction in brain cell death, the restoration of blood vessels and some brain activity. \\nThe researchers found working synapses - the connections between brain cells that allow them to communicate.\\nThe brains also showed a normal response to medication and used up the same amount of oxygen as a normal brain. \\nThis was all 10 hours after the pigs were decapitated.\\nCrucially there was no sign of the brain-wide electrical activity in an electroencephalogram (EEG brain scan) that would signal awareness or perception. \\nFundamentally they were still dead brains. \\nThe research transforms ideas about how the brain dies, which many thought happened quickly and irreversibly without a supply of oxygen.\\nProf Nenad Sestan, a professor of neuroscience at Yale University, said: \"Cell death in the brain occurs across a longer time window that we previously thought.\\n\"What we are showing is the process of cell death is a gradual, stepwise process.\\n\"And that some of those processes can be either postponed, preserved or even reversed.\"\\nThe pig brains came from the pork industry; the animals were not raised in a lab for this experiment. \\nBut the Yale scientists were so concerned the pigs might become conscious that they gave drugs to the disembodied brains to reduce any brain activity.\\nAnd the team were constantly monitoring the brains to see if there was any sign of higher brain functions.\\nIn that case they would have used anaesthetic and ended the experiment. \\nEthicists, writing in Nature, say new guidelines are needed for this field because animals used for research could end up in a \"grey area - not alive, but not completely dead\".\\nThe immediate benefit of this work will be for scientists studying the brain in diseases like Alzheimer\\'s. \\nThe organ is the most complex structure in the known universe, but techniques such as freezing slices of the brain or growing colonies of brain cells in a dish do not let researchers explore the full 3D wiring of the brain. \\nIn the long term, scientists hope to find better ways of protecting the brain after traumas such as a stroke or being starved of oxygen at birth.  \\nDr Andrea Beckel-Mitchener, from the Brain Initiative at the US National Institute of Mental Health, said: \"This line of research could lead to a whole new way of studying the post-mortem brain.\\n\"It also could stimulate research to develop interventions that promote brain recovery after loss of brain blood flow.\"\\nHowever, the researchers say it is still far too early for the field to make a difference to patients after injury.\\nProf Sestan said: \"We don\\'t yet have knowledge whether we would be able to restore normal brain function.\"\\nAt the moment no, but some ethicists say we should have the debate now as people who are \"brain dead\" are a major source of organs for transplant.\\nProf Dominic Wilkinson, a professor of medical ethics and a consultant neonatologist in Oxford, said: \"Once someone has been diagnosed as \\'brain dead\\' there is currently no way for that person to ever recover.  \\n\"The human person that they were has gone forever.\\n\"If, in the future, it were possible to restore the function of the brain after death, to bring back someone\\'s mind and personality, that would, of course, have important implications for our definitions of death.\"\\nBut that is not currently the case. \\nProf Tara Spires-Jones, deputy director of the Centre for Discovery Brain Sciences at the University of Edinburgh, said: \"This study is a long way from preserving human brain function after death as portrayed in the cartoon Futurama where heads were kept alive in a jar.  \\n\"It is instead a temporary preservation of some of the more basic cell functions in the pig brain, not the preservation of thought and personality.\"\\nIn this experiment the answer is a clear no. The brains were effectively silent. \\nBut the research does ask as many questions as it answers: \\nFollow James on Twitter.',\n",
              " 'Mums-to-be could be routinely offered an ultrasound scan at 36 weeks to help spot risky breech deliveries, when a baby\\'s bottom or feet will emerge first, say UK researchers. \\nBreech births can be hazardous and tricky to diagnose.\\nCurrently, midwives and doctors tend to rely on the shape and feel of the mother\\'s bump to check. \\nResearchers estimate the scans would avoid 4,000 emergency caesareans and eight baby deaths a year in England. \\nIf the scans could be done cheaply enough then it should also save the NHS money in terms of care, says the University of Cambridge team in the journal PLoS Medicine. \\nAbout three to four babies in every 100 are in a breech position near the end of pregnancy. \\nMore babies start out breech but will turn to the ideal \"head-first\" position by about 36 weeks\\' gestation.\\nThe researchers offered breech scans to 3,879 pregnant women:\\nMaking the diagnosis at 36 weeks meant the women could be offered an attempt at manually encouraging the baby to turn in the womb to the head-first position before labour - a manipulation method called external cephalic version. \\nFor the women who declined, or where it did not work, a planned caesarean section was arranged. None of the women opted to attempt a vaginal breech birth, which is possible but carries some risk. \\nNineteen of the 179 women were able to deliver vaginally, 110 had a planned caesarean and 50 needed an emergency caesarean. \\nResearcher Prof Gordon Smith said it should be feasible to provide the service at a low cost, for example by making it a part of a standard midwife appointment and using inexpensive portable ultrasound machines. \\n\"If it was under Â£20 per patient then it would be cost-effective and if it could be done for under Â£13 then it should save the NHS money in the long run,\" he said.\\nExperts said the cost-effectiveness for the NHS should be explored.\\nPrivate patients can pay from Â£30 to Â£200 or more for a pregnancy ultrasound scan. \\nProf Andrew Shennan, professor of obstetrics at King\\'s College London, said the scans should be rolled out. \\n\"Breech can be difficult to manage in labour if previously unsuspected, as labour can be quick,\" he said.\\n\"Breech deliveries have some risk, and counselling and decision-making in labour can be challenging. Scans are routinely available now, and minimal skills are required to determine breech presentation. This should be implemented.\"\\nBut Prof Jean Golding, emeritus professor of paediatric and perinatal epidemiology at the University of Bristol, disagrees. She said bigger, randomised trials were needed first. \\nProf Basky Thilaganathan, from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said more research was needed, but added: \"So far, the evidence for its use looks very promising.\"',\n",
              " '\"It quickly became apparent that what had just happened was a catastrophe... I died in 2015, not now.\"\\nLesley Roberts was stunned as she read the devastating final email from her beloved son Alex Hardy.\\nThe email had been timed to arrive on 25 November 2017, 12 hours after he killed himself. Less than an hour before the email arrived, Lesley had opened her front door to find a police officer standing there, explaining her son was dead. \\nAlex was an intelligent and popular 23-year-old with no history of mental illness. Lesley could not understand why he would have wanted to take his own life.\\nHis email explained how the foreskin of his penis had been surgically removed two years before. This is commonly known as circumcision, but Alex had come to believe it should be regarded as \"male genital mutilation\".\\nHe never mentioned this to his family or friends when he was alive. Lesley did not even know her son had been circumcised.\\nIn the following months, she tried to find out more about circumcision. Why had it affected Alex so badly, and why did he feel killing himself was his only option?\\nAlex was the eldest of Lesley\\'s three sons and had been very much longed for, having been conceived after fertility treatment.\\nLesley says her \"dreams came true\" when she became a mother in July 1994.\\n\"He was everything I could have wished for,\" she says. \"Gorgeous, easygoing, and adoring of his younger brother Thomas who arrived following more treatment almost three years later.\"\\nHe also adored his baby brother James, who was born when Alex was 13. The walls and windowsills of Lesley\\'s home in Cheshire are covered in photos of all of them.\\nAlex sailed through his education and was particularly gifted at English, so much so that his old school established the Alex Hardy Creative Writing Award in his memory.\\n\"Alex was passionate about history but as his English teacher I saw in him a true talent for writing,\" says Jason Lowe, who is now head teacher at Tarporley High School.\\nIt was while on a school skiing trip to Canada, aged 14, that Alex fell in love with the country. He had enjoyed skiing as a child and the trip reignited his passion. So, when Alex reached 18, he decided to defer university and live in Canada for a year.\\n\"He fell in love completely with Canada and made so many friends and got a promotion at work,\" says Lesley.\\n\"After one year he rang me and said \\'Mum, I\\'m deferring my place for university\\'. The same thing happened after year two.\"\\nTwo years turned into three, then four, and by the time of his death Alex had been living in Canada for five years and had obtained residency.\\n\"He was known as the \\'super-smart Brit\\' with impeccable manners,\" says his mother. \"The super-intelligent guy from the UK who helped people with their Canadian residency applications.\"\\nLesley visited her son several times, both alone and with his brothers and stepfather. They were a close family, but Alex did not tell any of them he was secretly suffering with a problem with his penis.\\n\"I had issues with a tight foreskin,\" he eventually wrote in his final email, \"but from my late teens it created issues in the bedroom as it meant my foreskin would not retract over the glans as intended which caused some awkward moments.\"\\nIn 2015, still silently suffering, Alex consulted a doctor in Canada. He was given steroid cream to stretch his foreskin, but went back to the doctor after just a few weeks because he did not think the treatment was working.\\nThe medical name for Alex\\'s problem is phimosis. It simply means his foreskin was too tight to pull back from the head of his penis, or the \"glans\" as Alex referred to it in his email. This is perfectly normal for boys in the early years of their life. As boys get older, their foreskin usually starts to separate from the head of the penis.\\nPhimosis does not always cause problems, but if it does, problems can include difficulty urinating and pain during sex. In England, the NHS advises topical steroids and stretching techniques - and circumcision as a last resort.\\nOver in Canada, where circumcision is more common, Alex was referred to a urologist.\\n\"He immediately suggested circumcision,\" Alex wrote. \"I asked about stretching and he completely lied to my face and said it would not work for me.\\n\"I was mostly trusting as I felt he was the expert who knew best in this regard so with a pinch of salt I accepted it.\"\\nLesley has since read online reviews of this urologist which have made her question his competence. One patient said she had been unable to work since having surgery for kidney problems, and he had \"destroyed\" her quality of life.\\n\"I\\'m a mother of three young children who are scared every day I will die as they see me suffering in so much pain,\" she wrote.\\n\"I can see how he misdiagnosed others, botched surgeries, and ruined lives,\" said another review. \"He\\'s dangerously incompetent.\"\\nAnother review of Alex\\'s urologist read: \"They left a surgical instrument in my bladder but I only got notified three months later. Run away before you get hurt!\"\\nLesley, who was \"horrified\" by these reviews, has asked for the urologist to be investigated. She has been told an inquiry is ongoing.\\nThe College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia told the BBC it \"cannot disclose the existence of a complaint against a physician, and only may do so if the complaint leads to formal discipline\".\\n\"I will wish with my last breath and with all of heart that my darling son had run away,\" says Lesley.\\nMuch to his regret, Alex was not able to research the urologist - or circumcision - properly at the time because his laptop was broken.\\nHe had tried researching the topic in a public computer space but felt uncomfortable, and also felt it was \"too much of a taboo\" to discuss with friends.\\nSo Alex booked what he believed was a minor procedure and had the surgery in 2015, at the age of 21.\\nIn the email to his mother, Alex explained, in great detail, the physical problems he had suffered afterwards.\\nHe described experiencing constant stimulation from the head of his penis, which was no longer protected by his foreskin.\\n\"These ever-present stimulated sensations from clothing friction are torture within themselves; they have not subsided/normalised from years of exposure,\" he wrote.\\n\"Imagine what would happen to an eyeball if the eyelid was amputated?\"\\n\"He was in so much pain that it hurt to do normal physical activity,\" says Lesley. \"He was a keen skier and snowboarder so you can imagine the pain he was in.\"\\nConsultant urological surgeon Trevor Dorkin, who is a member of the British Association of Urological Surgeons, advises his patients that the head of their penis will be more sensitive after circumcision.\\nHowever, this sensitivity usually reduces.\\n\"I always say to guys \\'it\\'s going to feel more sensitive to start with\\' because all of a sudden you haven\\'t got this protection over the head of the penis and it will feel different,\" says Mr Dorkin, who has carried out more than 1,000 circumcisions.\\n\"But in the vast majority of the cases the man adjusts to that, the brain adjusts to that, it adjusts to the signals that are coming back through the nerves from the head of the penis.\"\\nAlex also wrote about experiencing erectile dysfunction, and burning and itching sensations, particularly from a scar which sat where his frenulum was removed. The frenulum is a band of tissue where the foreskin attaches to the under surface of the penis. Some men refer to it as their \"banjo string\".\\n\"It\\'s one of the more erogenous zones so it\\'s thought to be important in sexual function,\" says Mr Dorkin.\\n\"The foreskin, the head of the penis and the frenulum is a very, very sensitive area.\\n\"But again when you do circumcision sometimes the frenulum is not preserved and it doesn\\'t necessarily have an effect on overall sexual function and enjoyment.\"\\nBut Alex felt his frenulum had been important.\\n\"Through its absence I can certainly verify it is the most erogenously sensitive area of the penis and male body overall,\" he wrote.\\n\"If someone were to amputate your clitoris you may begin to be able to understand how this feels.\"\\nHe wrote about experiencing cramps and contractions in his muscles and \"uncomfortable\" sensations which extended deep into his abdomen.\\nLesley does not know whether or not Alex had sex after his circumcision.\\n\"Where I once had a sexual organ I have now been left with a numb, botched stick,\" he wrote. \"My sexuality has been left in tatters.\"\\nHe asked: \"Nature knows best - how can chopping off a section of healthy tissue improve nature\\'s evolved design?\"\\nLike many people, Lesley admits she knew very little about the foreskin or circumcision before her son died.\\n\"I didn\\'t know anything apart from I believed it was a very routine surgery,\" she says.\\nThe foreskin is sometimes dismissed as a \"useless flap of skin\", but Mr Dorkin says it does have a purpose.\\n\"It covers the head of the penis,\" he says. \"In terms of what\\'s it for, it provides a bit of protection to the head of the penis. It\\'s thought to have some sort of immunological function perhaps.\"\\nCircumcision rates vary a lot depending on where you are in the world and which culture you grew up in.\\nAccording to the World Health Organization, 95% of men are circumcised in Nigeria but only 8.5% of men in the UK are.\\nMost of the men circumcised in the UK are either Muslim or Jewish, as circumcision is regarded as an important part of their religions.\\nAccording to the 2011 census, Muslims accounted for 4.8% of the population in England and Wales, while 0.5% were Jewish.\\nPeople who question circumcision are sometimes accused of being anti-Semitic or Islamophobic, but Lesley stresses her son was neither.\\n\"For me, this has nothing to do with religion at all. I respect all people of faith or indeed no faith, as Alex did,\" she says.\\nIn Canada, where Alex had moved to, an estimated 32% of men are circumcised.\\nAlex felt male circumcision has been normalised to the extent that most people do not question it, while female circumcision has become known as female genital mutilation (FGM) and is now illegal in many countries.\\nHe felt male circumcision should be known as \"male genital mutilation\" - a view shared by a growing anti-circumcision movement.\\n\"If I were a female (in Western nations) this would have been illegal, the surgeon would be a criminal and this would never have been considered as an option by doctors,\" Alex wrote.\\n\"I do not believe in championing one gender over another but I feel strongly that gender equality should be achieved for all.\"\\nCampaigners for \"genital autonomy\" believe it is wrong to circumcise a baby or child - whether they are male or female - because the patient cannot give consent, and these campaigners regard circumcision as a human rights issue.\\nHaving lived with an intact penis for 21 years, Alex believed men circumcised as babies or young children would \"tragically never be able to fully comprehend what has been taken away\". He estimated he had been stripped of 75% of the sensitivity of his penis.\\nHowever, experiences of men circumcised as adults differ dramatically.\\nSome men actually prefer sex afterwards because they no longer have the pain of a tight or inflamed foreskin. \\nSome report a significant loss in sensitivity and greatly reduced sexual pleasure. \\nSome report being less sensitive but say there is no change in their overall enjoyment of sex.\\nSome are very happy with their decision to get circumcised.\\nSome, like Alex, deeply regret having it done.\\nAlex sought further medical help following the circumcision as well as psychological help, but never shared his problems with his family or friends.\\n\"I was with him during those two years and I think I would be lying if I said I didn\\'t think something wasn\\'t right,\" says Lesley.\\n\"I did say \\'Is something bothering you? Are you OK?\\' and he would absolutely reassure me that he was.\"\\nLesley, who used to be a teacher, now hopes to go into schools and speak to young men about sharing their problems, even if they are very personal.\\n\"I think we all know that men don\\'t particularly tend to talk about their problems in the same way that girls do but I think circumcision is very much a taboo subject,\" she says.\\n\"Alex was reserved. He certainly wouldn\\'t have said \\'I\\'ve got a tight foreskin and it really hurts\\'. And he didn\\'t. And I didn\\'t know.\"\\nOnly a week after Alex died, a friend opened up to Lesley about his own circumcision.\\n\"He told me he wouldn\\'t normally have mentioned it but he had a circumcision as an older man, 10 years ago, and he was in constant daily pain,\" says Lesley. \"It just seems it\\'s more common than you think.\"\\nMr Dorkin says serious problems following a circumcision are rare, but not unheard of.\\n\"You do hear of horror stories where a circumcision has been done poorly and there\\'s damage done to the head of the penis itself,\" he says.\\nSometimes too much skin is taken and this can result in what\\'s known as \"burying\" or shortening of the penis, where it gets pulled back into the body.\\n\"Surgeons at the end of the day are human and there is potential for human error and technical error during any operation,\" he says.\\n\"One of my mentors told me every case is a tricky case, that\\'s got to be your approach to surgery. You never take anything for granted in surgery.\"\\nThere have been cases of children and men dying after being circumcised.\\nFour-week-old Goodluck Caubergs bled to death after a nurse circumcised him at his home in Manchester, while one-month-old Angelo Ofori-Mintah bled to death after being circumcised.\\nSince 1995 at least 1,100 boys have died in South Africa after ritual circumcisions. Some penises fall off after becoming infected and rotten, while some have to be amputated.\\nIn Canada, where Alex was living, newborn baby Ryan Heydari bled to death after being circumcised by a doctor in Ontario.\\nRecently there have been reports of two babies dying within weeks of each other after home circumcisions in Italy, and a two-year-old boy died after being circumcised at a migrant centre in Italy. \\n\"I\\'m not qualified to say that circumcision is always bad, because it isn\\'t,\" says Lesley.\\n\"It certainly was in my son\\'s case and I think we need more research. We need to look into the risks, what can really go wrong, and we need to be more aware of them.\"\\nIf a circumcision is necessary, Mr Dorkin says it is important to tell patients about potential complications.\\n\"Particularly when you are doing the operation in a guy who is in his late teenage years or early adulthood, it\\'s a very sensitive area and sexual function is important, so you have to explain the risks to them,\" he says.\\n\"Alex said he was not made aware of all the risks,\" says Lesley. \"If he had, I feel sure he would not have had the surgery.\\n\"Alex wasn\\'t alone. I now know he wasn\\'t the only one that this has happened to. And that can\\'t be right.\"\\nThe UK charity 15 Square, which tries to educate people about circumcision, says Alex is not the only man to have killed himself after being circumcised.\\n\"It happens more frequently than people realise,\" says chairman David Smith.\\nThere are no statistics on men who have killed themselves after being circumcised. Alex died over a year ago but his story has not been told until now. An inquest into his death was held in the UK but it was not reported by the media.\\nLesley, who is normally private and reserved like her son, only agreed to share Alex\\'s story because it was his dying wish.\\n\"If the following information can benefit anybody then it has served its purpose,\" he wrote.\\n\"I did not feel comfortable raising the issue when I had a choice, so if my story can raise awareness to break this taboo within society regarding men\\'s health then I am happy for release of my words.\\n\"Alex said in his letter \\'We stand on the shoulders of those who came before us\\',\" says Lesley.\\n\"This is the last thing I\\'m doing for my precious son.\"\\nFor details of organisations which offer advice and support, go to BBC Action Line.',\n",

But there\\'s a problem.\\n\"Something was off with my baby\\'s body,\" she tells me.\\nCatherine asks her neighbour to come and take a look. She points at her child\\'s genitalia and the neighbour bends down.\\nShe looks silently.\\nWithout attempting to diagnose a condition, she tells Catherine not to worry. She assures her that her child will be fine.\\nBut Catherine wants a second opinion. This time she invites her cousin over.\\n\"My cousin asked me what the problem was. I told her to just go ahead and check the baby.\"\\nCatherine\\'s cousin agrees that \"something looks off\". She advises her to visit the local hospital.\\nThe next day Catherine and her husband go to their local doctor, who immediately refers them to Kenyatta National Hospital, the largest in the country.\\nThe diagnosis from the hospital stuns the couple.\\nCatherine and her husband are told that their child is born with an intersex condition. The baby possesses both male and female genitalia.\\nIn the paperwork where sex is to be marked, the doctor writes a question mark instead.\\n\"After returning from Kenyatta with the doctor\\'s report, that\\'s when my husband started pulling back from me,\" says Catherine. \"He stopped leaving behind money for food.\"\\nThey began to fight.\\nCatherine\\'s husband would yell at her that his family had no history of children with both a penis and a vagina, so there was no way that the child could be his.\\n\"He used to hurl insults at me, calling me a prostitute. I asked if the baby wasn\\'t his where did the child come from?\" Catherine says quietly. \"It is God who plans everything.\"\\nHer husband refused to attend any future hospital appointments for the child. To Catherine it began to seem that she would be left to raise her intersex child singlehanded, and the prospect terrified her.\\n\"I felt so alone and confused. One day I bought rat poison, so that I could kill myself and the baby. I mixed it in the meal. I remember it was beans.\"\\nBut she stopped herself at the last moment and ran to a church to speak to the pastor.\\nHe reassured her that she was not alone, that other children like hers do exist in the world - her child was not an aberration or a curse.\\n\"He told me that life will go on. The Lord will bless me and my child and both of us would survive.\"\\nCatherine made a decision. One month after their child was born, she left her husband and moved in with her sister and her family.\\nShe had been abused and shamed enough, and it wasn\\'t the life she wanted for herself or her child.\\nWeeks after giving birth, with no income coming in, Catherine returned to work at a children\\'s home weighted with worry.\\nOne thing troubling her was the suggestion that her child should have corrective surgery.\\n\"The doctor told me that the baby\\'s male hormones were stronger than the female hormones and that we should have surgery to sew up the vagina and give male hormones.\"\\nFor a long time she resisted the idea, but just over a year after the birth, she gave consent, believing it would be in the best interest of her baby. She quickly came to regret it.\\nThe second issue was the birth certificate.\\nIn order to obtain a birth certificate in Kenya a sex needs to be assigned to the child, but Catherine only had the forms where hospital staff had put a question mark next to a box indicating sex.\\nA question mark meant that a birth certificate could not be issued - and nor could an identity card or passport in Kenya.\\nCatherine knew that without these documents, she could not enrol her child into school, and that as an adult her child would not be allowed to vote.\\nEventually she confided in a colleague at work. He told her that he knew a man that may be able to help her. That was when Catherine met John Chigiti.\\nThe midwife who saved intersex babies\\nNow I have a penis, I hope I will find love\\nDoctors hid secret from me\\nEarlier in the same year, 2010, John Chigiti had become well-known in Kenya as the lawyer representing Richard Muasya, an intersex person who had been sexually harassed in a male prison. The court rejected Muasya\\'s plea to move to a female prison, but Chigiti earned a reputation as someone sympathetic towards intersex people, in a country where public opinion is often hostile.\\nThe birth of children with intersex traits is often seen as a curse or bad omen on the family, with many killed in infancy.\\nCatherine wanted three things, identity documents for her child to be able to attend school, a law preventing surgery on intersex children unless it is medically necessary and proper information and psychological support for parents.\\nChigiti agreed to represent her pro bono, and helped by a local NGO, The Cradle the Children Foundation, they filed a case with Kenya\\'s High Court before the end of of the year.\\nIn order to protect her child\\'s identity, Catherine called her child Baby A, so the case became known as Baby A v. Attorney General, Kenyatta National Hospital, and the Registrar of Births and Deaths.\\nIn a landmark ruling in 2014 the court ordered the government to issue a birth certificate to Catherine\\'s five-year-old child.\\nIn addition, it ordered the Attorney General to create a task force that would look at ways of providing better support for intersex children.\\nThat task force handed in its recommendations to the Attorney General this week. Its recommendations include delaying surgery until children can choose for themselves and a robust survey on the number of intersex people in Kenya.\\n\"Another strong recommendation is to have an \\'I-marker\\'â\\x80¦ an intersex marker to be put into public documentation,\" says Mbage Ng\\'ang\\'a, the Chair of the Kenya Law Reform Commission who headed the taskforce, \"as opposed to the binary state where we only recognise male and female in our official documentation.\"\\nA number of countries recognise a third gender that can be registered on official documents once someone\\'s gender identity becomes clear. The task force\\'s plan is different - it\\'s about sex rather than gender, and will register children as intersex at birth.\\nMbage Ng\\'ang\\'a says parliamentarians have shown strong support for the recommendations and that 2019 will bring major changes for the rights of intersex people. The case of Baby A inspired this, he says.\\nThese days Catherine survives by making and selling soap. Her immediate family and friends are aware of Baby A\\'s medical history. They support her.\\nSome days she doesn\\'t make any sales. \"But we get by,\" she says.\\nCatherine has raised Baby A, now almost 10, as a boy. \\nShe wonders if it was the right decision.

              " 'Seven-year-old Leia Armitage lived in total silence for the first two years of her life, but thanks to pioneering brain surgery and years of therapy she has found her voice and can finally tell her parents she loves them.\\n\"We were told you could put a bomb behind her and she wouldn\\'t hear it at all if it went off,\" said Leia\\'s father, Bob, as he recalled finding out their baby daughter had a rare form of profound deafness.\\nLeia, from Dagenham in east London, had no inner ear or hearing nerve, meaning that even standard hearing aids or cochlear implants wouldn\\'t help her.\\nAs a result, she was never expected to speak - but despite the risks, her parents fought for her to be one of the first children in the UK to be given an auditory brainstem implant, requiring complex brain surgery when she was two years old.\\nNHS England calls the surgery \"truly life-changing\" and has said it will fund the implant for other deaf children in a similar position.\\nIt is estimated that about 15 children a year will be assessed for the procedure and nine will go on to have surgery.\\nBob says opting for this type of brain surgery was a huge decision for them, but \"we wanted to give Leia the best opportunity in life\".\\nHe and his wife Alison hoped that after the surgery at Guy\\'s and St Thomas\\' NHS Foundation Trust she would be able to hear things like cars beeping their horns as she crossed the road - to make her safer in the world.\\nHowever, in the five years since the surgery, her progress has been much greater than they ever expected.\\nIt started slowly, with Leia turning her head at the sound of train doors closing shortly after the operation.\\nGradually, she started to understand the concept of sound while her parents continually repeated words, asking her to mimic the sound.\\nNow, after lots of regular speech and language therapy, she can put full sentences together, attempt to sing along to music and hear voices on the phone.\\n\"We can call her upstairs when we\\'re downstairs and she will hear us,\" Bob explains.\\nBut it\\'s at mainstream school, in a classroom with hearing children, where Leia is really flying, thanks to assistants using sign language and giving her plenty of one-to-one time.\\n\"She is picking up more and more and she\\'s not far behind others of her age in most things,\" Bob says.\\nAt home, using her voice is what pleases her parents most.\\n\"\\'I love you Daddy\\' is probably the best thing I\\'ve heard her say,\" Bob says.\\n\"When I\\'m putting her to bed she now says \\'good night Mummy\\', which is something I never expected to hear,\" Alison says.\\nThe cutting-edge surgery involves inserting a device directly into the brain to stimulate the hearing pathways in children born with no cochlea or auditory nerves.\\nA microphone and sound processor unit worn on the side of the head then transmits sound to the implant.\\nThis electrical stimulation can provide auditory sensations, but it cannot promise to restore normal hearing.\\nHowever, Prof Dan Jiang, consultant otologist and clinical director of the Hearing Implant Centre at Guy\\'s and St Thomas\\' NHS Foundation Trust, said some children can develop a degree of speech.\\n\"The outcomes are variable. Some will do better than others,\" he said.\\n\"They have to adapt to it and younger children do better so we like to insert the implant early if possible.\"\\nChildren under five are best placed to learn new concepts of sound and respond to intensive therapy, he said.\\nSusan Daniels, chief executive of the National Deaf Children\\'s Society, said: \"Every deaf child is different and for some, technology like auditory brainstem implants can be the right option and can make a huge difference to their lives.\\n\"With the right support, deaf children can achieve just as well as their hearing peers and this investment is another important step towards a society where no deaf child is left behind.\"',\n",

However eligibility criteria vary in different areas of the country. \\nIVF is not usually recommended for women over the age of 42 because of low success rates. \\nSource: Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority/Fertility Network UK  \\nMrs Cheshire said some parts of the sector were using \"blatant\" sales tactics to persuade \"vulnerable\" women to undergo treatment. \\nThe 50-year-old said she had even been offered IVF treatments herself, by staff who were unaware of her role with the regulator, at a visit to a fertility show in Manchester. \\n\"We now see things like \\'guaranteed baby or your money back\\',\\'\\' she told the Telegraph.\\nMrs Cheshire also called for the watchdog to be given powers to regulate prices, saying that some private centres were charging up to Â£20,000 for cycles - four times as much as she said treatments should cost. \\nShe said prices were often inflated by the growing use of \"add-on treatments\", such as embryo glue and endometrial scratches, offered by clinics to boost chances of success. \\nCaroline, 40, wishes someone had sat her down and given her a realistic cost for her IVF treatment but says that often medical staff do not know for sure.\\nShe was originally led to believe the cost would be Â£5,000 but it is now at least Â£16,000.\\n\"The list of treatment costs is just jargon and there are so many options. I think I needed someone to sit me down and say to me \\'this is you and this is what it will cost\\',\" she said.\\nThe cost is not the only downside of IVF treatment for Caroline - the hormones have added negatively to the experience.\\n\"I am taking some time off from treatment as I find injecting all the hormones really messes with me emotionally. The injections have bowled me over and made me completely lose it.\" \\nAdding: \"When you\\'re crying your eyes out at work it\\'s not a good look.\"\\nHowever, Caroline, whose full name we are not using at her request, thinks she will continue with the treatment as she has two vials of sperm left and will likely spend another Â£10,000.\\nHowever, earlier this year the watchdog, which regulates all fertility services in the UK, warned that these were being offered without conclusive evidence that they increase the chance of pregnancy. \\nIts website now has a \"traffic light\" rating for such treatments. None have been given the green light, which indicates there is more than one quality trial showing the procedure is effective and safe.',\n",

It then receives signals back when the movement has been completed before sending instructions for the next step.\\nProf Jog believes Parkinson\\'s disease reduces the signals coming back to the brain - breaking the loop and causing the patient to freeze. \\nThe implant his team has developed boosts that signal, enabling the patient to walk normally. \\nHowever, Prof Jog was surprised that the treatment was long-lasting and worked even when the implant was turned off.\\nHe believes the electrical stimulus reawakens the feedback mechanism from legs to brain that is damaged by the disease.\\n\"This is a completely different rehabilitation therapy,\" he said. \"We had thought that the movement problems occurred in Parkinson\\'s patients because signals from the brain to the legs were not getting through.\\n\"But it seems that it\\'s the signals getting back to the brain that are degraded.\"\\nBrain scans showed that before patients received the electrical treatment, the areas that control movement were not working properly. But a few months into the treatment those areas were restored.\\nGail Jardine, 66, is among the patients who has benefited from the treatment. \\nBefore she received the implant two months ago, Gail kept freezing on the spot, and she would fall over two or three times a day. \\nShe lost her confidence and stopped walking in the countryside in Kitchener, Ontario - something she loved doing with her husband, Stan.\\nNow she can walk with Stan in the park for the first time in more than two years.\\n\"I can walk a lot better,\" she said. \"I haven\\'t fallen since I started the treatment.

It aims to immunise 120,000 children aged two years and below.  The other two countries, Ghana and Kenya, will introduce the vaccine in the coming weeks.\\nThe three countries were picked because they already run large programmes to tackle malaria, including the use of bed nets, yet still have high numbers of cases.\\nMalaria kills some 435,000 people around the world each year, the majority of them children. Most of these deaths are in Africa, where more than 250,000 children die every year, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). \\nDr O\\'Brien said that malaria is \"a really difficult disease to develop a vaccine against\". \\nAn early trial of the vaccine began in 2009.\\n\"There were seven countries participating in a large trial where over 15,000 children participated,\" Dr David Schellenberg, who has been working on the development of the vaccine with the WHO, told the BBC\\'s Newsday programme.\\n\"[The trial] showed pretty clearly that this vaccine is safe and it is efficacious in terms of its ability to prevent clinical malaria episodes and also severe malaria episodes,\" he said. \\nRTS,S has been more than three decades in the making, with scientists from drugs company GSK creating it in 1987.\\nYears of testing supported by a host of organisations, including the Path Malaria Vaccine Initiative, and costing an estimated $1bn (Â£770m), have led to this point.\\nThe nearly 40% efficacy is not high in comparison with vaccines for other diseases, but Dr Schellenberg says RTS,S will add to the preventative measures, such as bed nets and insecticides, already being used.\\n\"Nobody is suggesting that this is a magic bullet,\" Dr Schellenberg said.\\n\"It may not sound like much but we\\'re talking about 40% reduction in severe malaria which unfortunately still has high mortality even when you have good access to good treatment,\" he added.\\nDr O\\'Brien said the vaccine lasted for at least for seven years and would target infants because they are most at risk.\\nThe vaccine needs to be given four times - once a month for three months and then a fourth dose 18 months later.\\nDr Schellenberg accepted that it might be a challenge for mothers in some areas to take their children to clinics for all four doses.\\nThis stage of the trial is expected to be completed by 2023, according to Path.',\n",

It\\'s just something we don\\'t and won\\'t talk about. We are very ashamed of it,\" says Bandile.\\n\"The doctor told me I\\'d pulled my hair from the root when I used glue to weave it. That glue wasn\\'t removed and it damaged the follicle root of my hair.\"\\nBandile blames the problem on the widespread belief that braids and plaits promote hair growth.\\n\"The misconceptions we grew up with was that a weave is more manageable than your natural hair.\"\\nAnd some estimates suggest women across Africa spend an estimated $6bn (Â£4bn) on weaves, braids and wigs each year.\\n\"Every woman feels more sophisticated with a weave. Half of us feel like when you\\'ve got a long weave and long hair, you look a bit more beautiful and you\\'re accepted better in society,\" she says.\\n\"Every black woman I know is obsessed with growing their hair long. They put thin plaits on the hairline, which pulls it.\"\\nIt is a story that Susan Magai, who owns a beauty salon in Tanzania\\'s main city Dar es Salaam, is all too familiar with.\\n\"Most of the women are using the wrong glue for their weaves or maybe they leave their braids or weaves in for extended periods of time,\" she says.\\n\"We advise our clients to leave weaves in for two weeks but some leave them in for three months and start to lose their hair.\"\\nMs Magai\\'s salon offers a steam treatment she says opens up the pores on the head to allow the hair to grow.\\n\"The steaming is like baking the hair. We use coconut oil and apply it on to the scalp. Then we cover the hair and bake it using a machine,\" she says, adding that it can take several months before the effects are visible.  \\nAccording to the Institute of Trichologists in the UK, steaming can be good for African hair because it adds moisture, which makes it more pliable and less prone to breakage. However, the association warns that steaming alone cannot stimulate growth after hair loss.\\nBandile tried a peppermint remedy to open up her scalp pores and after that failed, minoxidil - a blood pressure drug - which causes hair growth as a side-effect.\\n\"The hair was re-growing but it was becoming expensive so I left it,\" says the model who plans to see a trichologist in June about a possible hair transplant.\\nUK-based doctor Jumoke Koso-Thomas, who contributes to a blog focused on black women\\'s health, says that while hairstyling contributes to the majority of alopecia cases, for some there is also a genetic component.\\nFor example, hair loss can be a symptom of problems with the thyroid gland or iron deficiency, she says.\\n\"Childbirth, being on the pill and stress can also make women lose their hair,\" Dr Koso-Thomas adds, though such hair loss can be temporary. \\nBoitumelo Monyaki, a 39-year-old financial management student from Johannesburg, went completely bald eight years ago - something she believes was linked to the birth of her first child in 2002.\\n\"I\\'ve learnt that plenty of women in my family lose their hair after giving birth,\" she says.\\n It has been happening since my great-grandmother\\'s time.\"\\nMs Monyaki says losing her hair affected her confidence but she has learned to accept that her hair may never grow back to its previous fullness.\\nShe wants to see more help available for African women dealing with hair loss: \"Even salon owners and stylists don\\'t know how to treat this problem.\"\\nDr Koso-Thomas advises that a healthy balanced diet containing vitamin C, vitamin B and selenium, found in fresh fruit and vegetables, helps to nourish the hair root and can help combat traction alopecia - and avoiding stress can prevent hair loss too.\\nCrucially, she believes girls and younger women need to reassess the way they style their hair.\\n\"We need to be telling them: \\'Try not to do too much to your hair. Don\\'t put too many chemicals, don\\'t continually braid your hair. Let it rest, give it time to recover and do different styles at different times.\\'\"\\nBandile says it is advice that may gain ground as more women are going for the \"natural\" look.\\n\"They like their natural hair and are embracing their Africanness,\" she says, admitting that she is tired of \"always hiding under wigs\".\\n\"I want to just be able to go to work with a full head of natural hair.\"',\n",

They can\\'t sack you because that would be discrimination.\"\\nThe former surgeon said her work as an ambassador had helped her reconnect with her sense of purpose. \\n\"As a consultant surgeon I was helping 70, maybe 100 women a year with breast cancer.\\n\"But through my book, the blogging, the talking and being an ambassador for Working with Cancer, I can help hundreds, thousands of women.\"',\n",

              " 'Hundreds of thousands of people in Bangladesh have become hooked on yaba - a mixture of methamphetamine and caffeine sold as cheap red or pink pills. The official response has been harsh, with hundreds of people killed in alleged incidents of \"crossfire\". \\n\"I was awake for seven, eight, even 10 days at a time. I was taking yaba in the morning, the afternoon, in the evening, again late at night, and then working all night and not going to bed.\"\\nMohammed was an addict. After staying awake for so long, he would crash.\\n\"I would black out. I totally went down. After two or three days I would wake, have food, and go to bed again. But if I had any yaba, I would take it - if you have a single pill left, you will take it.\" \\nMohammed\\'s yaba habit started at work in Dhaka. \\n\"Our import business was with Japan so we had to work at night because of the time difference. One of my colleagues told me about yaba. He said that if I take it, it will help me stay awake, be more energetic and to work hard in the morning and late at night.\" \\nAt first, Mohammed experienced the benefits his colleague described. But they were short-lived. Mohammed began behaving erratically, and came close to breakdown.\\n\"In the early stages of using yaba it has a lot of positive effects. Everything is enhanced with yaba,\" says Dr Ashique Selim, a consultant psychiatrist specialising in addiction. \\n\"You become more sociableâ\\x80¦ You enjoy music, cigarettes and sex more. In Bangladesh there\\'s a very unhealthy association between yaba and sex - you\\'re awake longer, you\\'ve got more energy, you feel more confident. If you stop using yaba, there are no withdrawal symptoms, it\\'s not like alcohol or heroin. But it\\'s the effects of yaba that are really addictive. It\\'s a very, very dangerous drug.\"    \\nYaba first appeared in Bangladesh in 2002 and its use, and abuse, has steadily risen since then. Manufactured illicitly in industrial quantities in Myanmar, it is smuggled into Bangladesh in the far south-east of the country, where the border partly follows the River Naf. \\nIt was across this river that hundreds of thousands of desperate Rohingya refugees fled into Bangladesh in 2017, to escape from the Burmese military. Now nearly a million destitute refugees live in makeshift camps in the region and dealers have succeeded in turning some of them into mules - often women, who smuggle packages of pills inside their vaginas. \\nExperts believe the dealers see an unmissable business opportunity. At a time of rapid growth - Bangladesh has one of the world\\'s fastest growing economies - traffickers are dumping huge quantities of yaba, and selling it cheaply to create a captive market. Anecdotally, it seems its use is becoming more prevalent among go-getters riding the economic boom.   \\n\"I was totally dependent on it,\" remembers Mohammed.\\nHis wife, Nusrat, who was caring for a new-born baby at the time, says his behaviour became more and more unpredictable.\\n\"He used to come home and blame me for everything regarding food, friends, my jobâ\\x80¦ This was very unusual, and it\\'s not actually like him,\" she recalls. \\nAfter she found some yaba tablets in the house, she tackled Mohammed about them. \\n\"He screamed at me. I tried to convince him to get some treatment, but he was still denying it. He said, \\'You don\\'t trust me, you want to go away with someone else, you want to be apart from me.\\'  I had a tough time. And at the same time I knew he could do anything - he could even kill us.\"\\nAccording to Dhaka psychiatrist Ashique Selim, yaba has filled a unique role in Bangladesh, a nation where alcohol is not freely available, and drinking is often frowned upon.    \\n\"I had a gentleman who came to me who\\'d led a pretty straight life. His parents were very conservative.  So when his friends would go out and have a few beers, he wouldn\\'t do that because he didn\\'t want to come home smelling of drink. Then in his 30s he came across yaba. So there were no visual changes in the way he looked, and there was no smell. And when he was having small doses there was no effect the day after.\"\\nBut yaba users struggle to keep their habit purely recreational. And it is the drug\\'s widespread availability, and the chaos it is causing, that provoked the Bangladeshi government to ratchet up the penalties for yaba possession, and to declare \"zero tolerance\" - a policy that some claim involves summary execution by law enforcement agencies. \\n\"I was coming back from the mosque, when I saw a lot of policemen in front of my gate,\" remembers Abdur Rahman, who lives in Teknaf, the town at the heart of the yaba trade in the south-eastern district of Cox\\'s Bazar. \\n\"They entered my house, and found my son, Abul Kalam in the bathroom. They grabbed him and handcuffed him. I said, \\'Please release him, what has he done?\\' The policeman told me, \\'If you talk too much, we\\'re going to shoot you.\\'\"\\nAbul Kalam had recently served a prison sentence for human trafficking, not drugs. He was held in the police station for five days before his father got some very bad news.\\n\"The police told me my son was killed in a gunfight,\" he says.\\nAbul Kalam died on 9 January some distance from the police station in what the police said was an incident of crossfire. The media reported another man was killed alongside him, and that 20,000 yaba tablets and five guns were recovered from the scene. \\nOne human rights organisation estimates that in 2018, in the first seven months of the government\\'s anti-drug operations, nearly 300 people were killed across Bangladesh. The local press often puts the word \"crossfire\" in inverted commas, reflecting a widespread suspicion that sometimes these shoot-outs are staged. \\nListen to Bangladesh v Yaba on Crossing Continents, on BBC Radio 4, at 11:00 on Thursday 25 April\\nOr catch up later online\\nBut the Superintendent of Police for Cox\\'s Bazar, A B M Masud Hossain, denies there is a shoot-to-kill policy for those suspected of involvement in the yaba trade.  \\nSo how does he explain the circumstances of Abul Kalam\\'s death?  \\n\"Sometimes when we go for an operation, we face the yaba traders. I think that was such a type of incident,\" he says.\\n\"After arresting someone we take them to the police station. Then, after collecting information during interrogation, we go for the operation. So when you take the criminals on the operation, sometimes they fight the police with guns. So maybe he was killed at that time.\"\\nAnd he has an explanation, too, for the fact that these deaths always seem to follow a similar pattern.\\n\"They may be the same stories, but the incidents always occur like this. So why would I give another story?\" \\nIn February, the superintendent organised an extraordinary public event in Teknaf. In a carnival atmosphere, in front of a crowd of thousands, 102 local men - all alleged yaba dealers - surrendered to the authorities. They included relatives of the former local MP for the ruling Awami League, and of other elected representatives. Thirty firearms and packets containing 350,000 yaba tablets were laid out ceremoniously. The men who had given themselves up lined up in front of a podium decked with flowers, and each of them was presented with a single gladiolus flower by the Home Minister, Assaduzaman Khan. \\n\"The entire country is flooded with yaba, even students in schools and colleges are dependent on it,\" the minister told the assembled crowd. \\nThen he addressed the men who had turned themselves in, and who remain incarcerated today. \\n\"Your very presence today is reassurance for all of us that we shall be able to eradicate yaba from Teknaf and the rest of the country.\"\\nIt sounded as though those alleged yaba traders came forward of their own volition. But one man claims that his brother, Shawkat Alam, surrendered because he feared for his life.   \\n\"The police made a list of all the people who had to be \\'crossfired\\', something like that,\" says Mohamed Alamgir. \"And when my brother heard about it, he was so frightened that made him surrender.\" \\nPolice superintendent A B M Masud Hossain rejects the allegation that pressure was applied. \\n\"I can assure you, there is no crossfire list. We always try to arrest them.\"\\nAnd he says, since February\\'s surrender, yaba trading in the district of Cox\\'s Bazar has decreased by almost 70%. \\nIn 2018, Bangladeshi authorities seized 53 million yaba tablets nationally. The total value of this illicit business is estimated to be worth upwards of $1bn a year. \\nThere are no reliable surveys of the number of drug-dependent people in Bangladesh. The Department of Narcotics Control (DNC) estimates there are four million addicts, but NGOs have put the number at nearer seven million. Of those, about a third are thought to be yaba users. \\nMohammed\\'s yaba highs were quickly replaced by wretched lows.  \\n\"I was always confused and felt that somebody was overhearing me, somebody was looking at me.\"\\nParanoia is not unusual among yaba users.\\nAs his life spiralled out of control, Mohamed was forcibly taken to a rehabilitation centre in the middle of the night by strangers employed by his family. It was traumatic, but he is grateful now. He spent four months in treatment, has been clean for more than a year, and still volunteers in the same clinic - partly to prevent his own relapse.       \\n\"Now I think he\\'s ready to get a job again,\" says Nusrat, Mohammed\\'s wife. \"But I never push him. And if he says he needs some help, we\\'re all here for him.\"\\nMohammed\\'s addiction to yaba proved a profound test of this couple\\'s relationship.\\n\"But our bond has become stronger,\" believes Nusrat. Mohammed agrees.\\n\"And I have more faith in her. I know she won\\'t leave me!\" he says. \\nWhen soldiers went searching for militants in Myanmar\\'s Rakhine state last October, the result for members of the Rohingya minority was disastrous.

              " 'Dementia is the greatest health challenge of our time, the charity Alzheimer\\'s Research UK has warned. \\nDementia was first described by the German doctor Alois Alzheimer in 1906 after he performed an autopsy on a woman with profound memory loss.\\nWhat he found was a dramatically shrunken brain and abnormalities in and around nerve cells.\\nAt the time dementia was rare and was then barely studied for decades.\\nBut today somebody is diagnosed with it every three seconds, it is the biggest killer in some wealthier countries and is completely untreatable. \\nSo what is this disease? Why is it becoming more common? And is there any hope?\\nNo - dementia is a symptom found in many diseases of the brain. \\nMemory loss is the most common feature of dementia, particularly the struggle to remember recent events.\\nOther symptoms can include changes to behaviour, mood and personality, becoming lost in familiar places or being unable to find the right word in a conversation. \\nIt can reach the point where people don\\'t know they need to eat or drink.\\nAlzheimer\\'s disease is by far the most common of the diseases that cause dementia. \\nOthers include vascular dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, fronto-temporal dementia, Parkinson\\'s disease dementia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and the newly discovered Late.\\nGlobally around 50 million people are currently living with dementia. \\nBut cases are predicted to soar to 130 million by 2050 as populations age.\\nAccording to the World Health Organization, deaths from dementia have doubled since 2000 and dementia is now the fifth biggest killer worldwide. \\nBut dementia has already claimed number one spot in some richer countries.\\nIn England and Wales, one in eight death certificates cite dementia. \\nThere is also a key difference with other major killers such as cancer or heart disease, because there is not a single treatment that either cures or slows the pace of any dementia. \\n\"Dementia certainly is the biggest health challenge of our time,\" Hilary Evans, chief executive of the charity Alzheimer\\'s Research UK, told the BBC.\\n\"It\\'s the one that will continue to rise in terms of prevalence, unless we can do something to stop or cure this disease.\"\\nAs the disease progresses, people eventually need full-time care and the annual cost of looking after people with dementia is in the region of $1 trillion a year.\\nThe answer is simple - we are living longer and the biggest risk factor for dementia is age.\\nThat is why huge increases in dementia cases are predicted for Asia and Africa.\\nWith a more philosophical hat on, you can see dementia as the price we pay for progress in treating deadly infections, heart attacks and cancer. \\nAlthough there is an unexpected and hopeful trend emerging that has surprised some in the field - the proportion of elderly people getting dementia is falling in some countries.\\nStudies have shown the dementia rate (the number of cases per 1,000 people) falling in the UK, Spain and the US and stabilising in other countries.\\nThis is largely being put down to improvements in areas like heart health and education which in turn benefit the brain.\\nNot necessarily.\\nThere used to be a public perception that dementia was a normal part of the ageing process. \\nHowever, the research is clear - dementia is caused by disease.\\nAnd some people who live well into their 90s and beyond have brains that remain remarkably clear of any signs of dementia. \\nProf Tara Spires-Jones, the deputy director of the centre for discovery brain sciences at the University of Edinburgh,  said: \"I think there are some people who would be fine, even if they lived for another 100 years.\"\\nBe in no doubt - even a drug that just slows the progression of dementia would make someone a fortune.\\nIt is not for the want of trying that there is no treatment for dementia. \\nAducanumab, a drug that many hoped would work in Alzheimer\\'s disease, is just the latest to fall by the wayside. \\nIn March this year, Biogen and Eisai announced their drug was unlikely to be effective and ended the trial early. \\nAducanumab, like those that have failed before, had been designed to target a toxic protein called amyloid beta that builds up inside the brain of patients with Alzheimer\\'s disease. \\nIf you go back to Dr Alzheimer in 1906, then some of the abnormalities he found in that brain autopsy were plaques of amyloid beta. \\nSo a clear connection between amyloid beta and Alzheimer\\'s emerged and the assumption was that the protein was killing brain cells. \\nTherefore removing amyloid beta should save brain cells and slam the brakes on Alzheimer\\'s, experts thought.\\nThe drug companies poured in.\\nMs Evans said: \"Some pharmaceutical companies were jumping on that thinking it was going to be the golden bullet, that hasn\\'t been the case.\"\\nAnd they left other avenues, relatively, unexplored.\\n\"A lot of pharmaceutical companies put all their eggs in one basket,\" says Ms Evans.\\nHas science made a massive, expensive mistake? Is the \"amyloid hypothesis\" dead? These are questions being asked.\\nProf Bart De Strooper, the director of UK Dementia Research Institute, told me: \"The amyloid hypothesis as has been formulated over the last 20 years is dead, that I would accept.\\n\"What I won\\'t accept is that the importance of amyloid is dead.\"\\nThere is a tonne of evidence that supports amyloid having a role in some dementias.\\nThis includes genetic studies on people with familial dementia, who develop the disease in their 30s and 40s. It is caused by rare mutations in their DNA that alter the way amyloid works in the body. \\nProf De Strooper says: \"The genetic evidence for amyloid is so strong that it\\'s hard to go to the other side, which says that amyloid has nothing to do with the disease.\\n\"What we need is a new theory.\"\\nThe role of amyloid beta is being reimagined.\\nSo instead of being the toxic protein that chokes nerve cells to death, it is being seen as the initial step that culminates in the dementia. \\nProf Spires-Jones said: \"Some people call it a trigger and once you\\'ve pulled the trigger then the bullet is on its way.\\n\"So doing anything to the trigger is no longer an effective method.\"\\nThe optimistic view is that anti-amyloid drugs may have a role in preventing Alzheimer\\'s, but only if they are used before the disease starts. \\nThat may be why the current Alzheimer\\'s drug trials have failed, because people are being treated too late.\\nSome researchers are pinning hopes on another protein called tau. \\nIf amyloid beta is the trigger, tau may be the bullet.\\n\"Tau is one of my favourite proteins, where there\\'s tau there\\'s cell death in the brain,\" says Prof Spires-Jones.\\n\"I think tau is very important for somehow causing the cells to get sick and die.\"\\nHowever, again this is not 100% certain and there is no evidence in human trials that lowering levels of tau in the brain is going to stop neurones dying. \\nFocusing on neurones and dangerous proteins can miss the bigger picture of what is happening in the brain. \\nThis is a lesson being learned from cancer, where understanding the role the immune system plays has led to a whole new branch of medicine - cancer immunotherapy.\\nThe immune system is being heavily implicated in dementia too. \\nIf you look at genetic mutations that increase the risk of developing dementia, then a good chunk of them are involved in the immune system. \\nWhile your brain is packed with neurones that do the \"thinking\" - they are ably assisted by special immune cells called microglia. \\nThey do fight infections, but also keep the brain running smoothly by munching up anything that should not be there. \\nAnd the blood vessels in the brain are increasingly being seen as a key player, not just in vascular dementia, but other dementias too. \\nProf De Strooper still sees abnormal proteins as the trigger, but \"then you have the response of the brain on that threat\". \\nHe told the BBC: \"Some people have very good genes, very strong inflammation response or a very good vascular (blood vessel) response, and they will maintain good health even while these biochemical changes are present in the brain.\"\\nAnd, on the flip side, some people who are genetically programmed to respond poorly would go on to develop dementia symptoms. \\nProf De Strooper said: \"All of a sudden, you open a broad box of possible drug targets, because you can then start to think about how do we improve the response of the brain at the inflammatory side, at the vascular side, at the neuronal side? \\n\"That\\'s what at this moment is happening.\"\\n\"Unfortunately, we don\\'t have a full understanding,\" says Prof Spires-Jones.\\nShe said there were key gaps in our knowledge:\\n\"So there\\'s some big questions left that we need to understand in order to effectively treat the disease,\" she said.\\nBut we have switched from talking about all dementias to mostly Alzheimer\\'s disease, where most of the medical research has been focused.\\nEach type of dementia has different traits, with different parts of the brain affected and different aberrant proteins building up in the brain.\\nFor example, alpha-synuclein builds up in dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson\\'s disease dementia.  \\nThere may need to be different treatments targeting different proteins and confusingly some patients have \"mixed dementia\", with multiple diseases playing out at the same time.\\nThere are two significant factors - one is the sheer complexity of the brain and the other is a lack of funding for research. \\nThe human brain is the most complex structure in the known universe and is made up of 100 billion neurones.\\nTo steal Prof de Strooper\\'s analogy; if every person on the planet (currently around 7.5 billion) had a computer and they were all hooked up and working together - that would still be less than a tenth of what\\'s going on inside the brain. \\nAnd yet for every single scientific study published on any form of neurodegeneration, there are 12 on cancer. \\nThe focus has simply been elsewhere.\\nLess than you might think.\\nWhile completely curing all forms of dementia is the goal, there could be huge benefits from drugs that just slow the pace of a dementia. \\nAn analysis by Alzheimer\\'s Research UK argued a drug that delayed the onset of dementia by five years would cut the number of people living with the disease by a third.\\nThe reason is dementia tends to be a disease of old age, and if you can buy just a little bit of time then you may well have died of other causes before your brain is affected.\\nSlowing the decline would also keep people living independently for longer. \\nProf Spires-Jones said: \"How resilient is the brain? It\\'s phenomenal!\"\\nAfter a stroke kills brain cells it is possible to regain some degree of lost function. But this does not come from growing new brain cells, but rewiring those that remain. \\nProf Spires-Jones told the BBC: \"In Alzheimer\\'s disease and other dementias, there\\'s a similar amount of ability of the brain to cope by changing the network.\"\\nIn fact, huge amounts of damage have already been done to the brain by the time somebody is diagnosed with Alzheimer\\'s by their family doctor. \\n\"When you look at people at that stage, they\\'ve already lost half of the neurones in a part of the brain really important for memory, the entorhinal cortex,\" Prof Spires-Jones said.\\nBut that creates a new problem - starting treatment at this stage is not going to recover those lost brain cells. You are mostly born with all the brain cells you will ever have (there are some exceptions).\\nLet\\'s fast forward to a world where we do have treatments and now the brain\\'s great asset, its adaptability, is the problem as it may have masked the disease for more than a decade. \\nMs Evans, from Alzheimer\\'s Research UK, said: \"There\\'s no point halting the progression of the disease in end stage disease.\"\\nBut equally it will not be practical for everybody to have a regular brain scan to catch dementia early, because those scans are incredibly expensive. \\nOne option is the approach taken in heart disease, where millions of people take pills to lower cholesterol levels in order to stop their arteries being clogged up. \\nStatins lower risk before people have a medical problem. \\nMs Evans said: \"I think the analogy with statins is a good one.\\n\"I think there could be something that in mid-life, you would be able to take that could then lower your risk or ensure that the development of this disease would be slow.\"\\nProf de Strooper envisages a system of screening people that may even start at birth with a DNA test that predicts who is at greater risk.\\nThen regular cognitive tests throughout life would act like an early warning system for people who need a more detailed examination. \\nAnd patients who turn out to already have a diseased brain would be offered drugs that stop brain cells dying, all before symptoms emerge.\\nThere are no guarantees, but there are ways you can lower the odds of developing dementia. \\nResearch estimates that one in three cases could be prevented by lifestyle changes including:\\nIt is not completely clear why these protect the brain. \\nDo these lifestyle factors actually stop the process of dementia in the brain?\\nOr do they prepare the brain for dementia by increasing the connections and flexibility of the brain so that as neurones start to die, the brain can compensate for longer and symptoms don\\'t emerge?\\nOn a personal level it probably doesn\\'t matter - not getting dementia, is not getting dementia. But scientifically the questions matter as the answers will illuminate what is going on in the brain. \\n\"People who are very healthy and take good care of themselves are the group that I would say is most resilient to Alzheimer\\'s disease,\" says Prof Spires-Jones.\\nThere is now far more money being spent on dementia research. \\nThe optimistic view is that we are at the same point as the Aids crisis was in the 1980s, when an HIV infection was a death sentence. \\nBut now people who get anti-viral drugs have a nearly normal life expectancy. \\nProf Spires-Jones said: \"We know from things like cancer, that if you do a lot of science and research into a field, you can make a huge difference and find cures and treatments for these complex diseases. \\n\"So I think we\\'ll get there, but we do need to understand more about the fundamental brain changes in order to come up with effective treatments.\"\\nMs Evans said: \"There are potential trials, within this year, coming to fruition, I would hope to see some positive stories out of those in the next year or two.\\nAnd Prof de Strooper expects the first treatment within a decade: \"It will not cure all dementia, I think we will have to cope with that for a long time. \\n\"But it will certainly postpone the disease, you will decay much slower, and dementia will be much less a threat for the society.\"\\nFollow James on Twitter.',\n",

But all historical biographical documents suggest Leonardo used his right hand when he was creating other kinds of works.\\nFor this research, two artworks - showing Leonardo da Vinci in the latter stages of his life - were analysed. One is a portrait of the artist, drawn with red chalk, attributed to the 16th-century Lombard artist Giovanni Ambrogio Figino. \\nUnusually, it shows his right arm largely concealed in folds of clothing. His hand is visible, but in a \"stiff, contracted position\".\\nDr Davide Lazzeri, a specialist in plastic reconstructive and aesthetic surgery at the Villa Salaria Clinic in Rome, who led the analysis, said: \"Rather than depicting the typical clenched hand seen in post-stroke muscular spasticity, the picture suggests an alternative diagnosis such as ulnar palsy, commonly known as \\'claw hand\\'.\"\\nThe ulnar nerve runs from the shoulder to the little finger, and manages almost all the intrinsic hand muscles that allow fine motor movements, so a fall could have caused trauma to his upper arm, leading to the palsy, or weakness.\\nThere are no reports of any cognitive decline or other motor impairment, which offers further evidence that a stroke was an unlikely cause of Leonardo\\'s impairment. Dr Lazzeri said.\\nHe added: \"This may explain why he left numerous paintings incomplete, including the Mona Lisa, during the last five years of his career as a painter, while he continued teaching and drawing.\"\\nA further image, an engraving of a man playing a lira da braccio - a Renaissance string instrument - was examined.

              " 'Meat-free foods that \"bleed\" like the real thing are becoming increasingly common. Could these vegetarian alternatives replace \"traditional\" burgers and sausages?\\nConcerns about the environmental and health impact of our diets has seen interest in vegetarian and vegan foods grow. \\nThis has boosted everything from flexitarianism to vegan sausage rolls and campaigns like \"Veganuary\".   \\nWhile Quorn and Linda McCartney once ruled the meat substitute aisles of our supermarkets, new companies are appearing with a radically different vision of \"meat-free\". \\nVegetarian \"meat\" designed to mimic the look, smell and taste of the real thing are already available, while scientists are developing lab-grown meats \\nBut with the arrival of these new dishes comes an increasingly animated debate about what can be called \"meat\", as well as how - and even if - it should be sold.  \\nThe first type of these new meat alternatives are plant-based products. \\nThese are already available in restaurants, pubs and supermarkets, contributing to a growing market worth an estimated Â£4.6bn. Last week, the value of US firm Beyond Meat rose to nearly $3.8bn (Â£2.9bn) after its Wall Street debut.\\nThe aim of plant-based \"meat\" is for it to be so similar to cook and eat as the real thing, that it is virtually indistinguishable.  \\nIt is made from plant proteins - usually wheat, pea or potato. Natural colourings like beetroot juice usually provide the \"blood\". \\nAnother US firm, Impossible Foods, has developed a plant version of heme - which gives beef its colour and taste.\\nThe second type of meat alternative is known as cultured or clean meat, which is produced using animal stem cells. \\nThese cells are grown in a lab or bioreactor, usually with the help of a growth-enhancing substance taken from a calf foetus.\\nThe process is arguably closer to a scientist growing replacement tissues and organs than the work of a cattle farmer. \\nAlthough not yet available in shops and restaurants, the techniques are being explored in a number of countries and could be on our plates in a matter of years.\\nA firm called Just hopes to have its lab-grown chicken on US shelves by the end of 2019.  \\nThese meat analogues are not aimed at vegetarians and vegans. \\nThere are high hopes that both the plant-based and lab-grown meats will appeal to hardened meat-eaters.\\nBut getting these products on to our plates is not as straightforward as simply putting them into shops and restaurants.\\nArguably, the biggest hurdle is getting permission to sell them. \\nCultured meat firms must undergo a rigorous safety assessment.\\nIn the EU, this process can take up to two years. If the European Food Safety Authority decides the product is safe to eat, a decision must be made about whether it can go to market - and how it should be labelled.\\nIn the US, the timeframe is less certain and relies on approval from two separate departments: the Food and Drug Administration, which regulates the collection and culturing of animal cells, and the US Department of Agriculture, which decides how cultured meat can be marketed.\\nEven with approval from regulators, there is still the need to win over the public.\\nFor many consumers, the so-called \"yuck\" factor of lab-grown meat could be too strong for it to be considered an alternative to real meat - or something they even want to eat.\\nFor others, the most important thing may be clear and transparent information on what they are eating and from where it has come. \\nIn the US, there are demands for a more precise definition of \"meat\" before this new technology hits the shelves. \\nThe term should only be used to describe \"the tissue or flesh of animals that have been harvested in the traditional manner\", the US Cattlemen\\'s Association argues.\\nFor producers of meat alternatives, the outcome of these debates could make or break their businesses. \\nIt is thought that consumers are more likely to buy meat described as \"clean\" or \"slaughter-free\" than \"lab-grown\".\\nMore like this\\nNaming is also important to the plant-based \"meats\", with opposition to the use of terms like \"burger\", \"steak\" or \"sausage\" to describe them growing.\\nThe EU is to consider proposals to restrict these terms solely to describe edible animal products. It led to reports that this could mean veggie burgers and sausages might have to take on more descriptive names like \"discs\" and \"tubes\".\\nFrance has already chosen to ban the \"misleading\" labelling of vegetarian products, suggesting that labels including \"veggie burger\" and \"vegan bacon\" risk confusing people. \\nProducers and investors in plant-based and cultured meat hope it will rival the taste, cost and convenience of conventional meat.\\nSome think it could take the place of our most environmentally-damaging meats and help meet climate targets.\\nConventional meat production is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions and a leading driver of environmental damage. A shift in diets has been described by scientists as critical to tackling climate change.\\nPlant-based \"meat\" produces significantly fewer greenhouse gas emissions and requires far less land and water. \\nHowever, growing meat in a lab still requires lots of energy. A report from the Oxford Martin School suggested that in some circumstances - over the very long term, and not taking into account emissions from land-use change associated with livestock production - lab meat could result in more warming than meat from cattle.\\nLab-grown meat is still only being produced in small quantities, meaning it is difficult to assess what large-scale production could look like.\\nAnother issue is how a switch to meat alternatives would affect livestock farmers, some of whom argue that much of the land on which animals are farmed is not fertile enough for crop production. \\nFor consumers, there are important questions.\\nAre they willing to rethink the role of animal farming in diets and in our culture?\\nAnd if \"meat\" comes from plants or animal cells is it still meat at all?\\nAbout this piece\\nThis analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from an expert working for an outside organisation. \\nLaura Wellesley is a research fellow in the Energy, Environment and Resources Department at Chatham House.

              " 'Cuba has long been renowned for its medical diplomacy - thousands of its doctors work in healthcare missions around the world, earning the country billions of dollars in cash. But according to a new report, some of the doctors themselves say conditions can be nightmarish - controlled by minders, subject to a curfew and posted to extremely dangerous places, James Badcock reports.\\nFor Dayli Coro, medicine was a calling.\\n\"I studied medicine out of vocation. I used to sleep between three and four hours because I studied so hard. I worked hard in my first year of practice, I took on a lot of extra shifts. And now here I am. I cannot be a doctor in Cuba. It\\'s very frustrating.\"\\nDayli, now 31 years old, wanted to be an intensive care specialist. She says that after graduating, she was told that if she went on a medical mission to Venezuela, she would gain experience in her chosen field and that it would count as her three years of obligatory social service, which all graduates have to complete in Cuba before gaining full-status posts.     \\nShe agreed to join what Havana calls its \"internationalist missions\", following a path trodden by hundreds of thousands of Cuban doctors.  Since 1960, their medical work overseas has been held up by the communist government as a symbol of its solidarity with people all over the world. Fidel Castro described the medics as Cuba\\'s \"army of white coats\".\\nAs well as a source of great pride and prestige, it is also an economic lifeline for the regime. The scheme earns Cuba much-needed foreign currency.\\nWith more than 30,000 Cuban doctors currently active in 67 countries - many in Latin America and Africa, but also European nations including Portugal and Italy - Cuba\\'s authorities draw up strict rules in an attempt to prevent citizens defecting once abroad. \\nThe wages on offer were another strong incentive for Dayli, who is originally from the small Cuban city of CamagÃ¼ey, to join up. Going from a doctor\\'s salary on the island of just $15 a month in 2011, she says she was paid $125 monthly for the first six months in Venezuela, a figure that rose to $250 after six months and $325 during her third year. Her family in Cuba also received a bonus of $50 a month. \\nAccording to a report by Prisoners Defenders, a Spain-based NGO that campaigns for human rights in Cuba and is linked to the Patriotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU) opposition group, doctors on average receive between 10% and 25% of the salary paid by the host countries, with the rest being kept by Cuba\\'s authorities.\\nDayli says she voluntarily signed a contract for a three-year stint, but she neither had time to read it, nor was she given a personal copy.\\nIn October 2011, the young doctor was posted to a clinic in the Venezuelan town of El Sombrero. The placement was part of the Barrio Adentro (Inside the Neighbourhood) scheme, which has distributed Cuban doctors around disadvantaged parts of the South American country since 2003 as a symbol of Cuban support for the regime of the late President Hugo ChÃ¡vez and his successor, NicolÃ¡s Maduro. Venezuela pays for this and other services by Cuban workers with oil. \\nDayli says she found herself in a virtual war zone - one in which she became accustomed to having a gun pointed at her.\\nVenezuela was at that time in the midst of a crime rate spiral that has led to a murder rate of 92 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2016, according to the NGO Venezuelan Observatory of Violence. World Bank figures put the 2016 figure at 56 per 100,000, topped only by El Salvador and Honduras. \\n\"There were many criminal gangs,\" says Dayli. \"When they fought, they brought their injured to us, because the local Venezuelan hospital had a police presence, and we didn\\'t. These kids would bring in a patient with 12 or 15 bullets in his body, point their guns at you and say you had to save him. If he died, you would die. That kind of thing happened on a daily basis. It was routine.\"\\nThe gang members she treated were often just teenagers of 15 and 16, she says. \\n\"I had one with a bullet through the heart, another with five in the head. Some would be alive but you knew that if they were not operated on in 20 minutes, they would die, and we didn\\'t have the necessary conditions. We didn\\'t even have basic medicine to treat patients there. There were supposed to be four intensive care doctors, and normally there was only one on shift.\" \\nThese patients would often be transferred by ambulance to a general hospital 45 minutes away. Sometimes the gang members would order Dayli to get in the ambulance with them, she says. \\n\"Once an ambulance was shot up by another gang and a Venezuelan doctor and the driver were killed,\" Dayli adds. \"There was always the possibility that the rival gang might try to finish off the patient during the transfer. I had a situation where a rival gang came in and shot the patient dead.\\n\"I was 24, a tiny, skinny girl. But in a place where there is so much violence, you develop an incredible emotional coldness.\" \\nThe medical missions came under the spotlight following decision to withdraw Cuban doctors from Brazil in the wake of President Jair Bolsonaro\\'s election last year. Bolsonaro questioned the qualifications of the Cuban doctors in the country and described their contractual situation as \"slave labour\", pointing out that they only kept 25% of the pay with the rest going to the Cuban government. In response, Cuban authorities strongly rejected the characterisation and said it was \"not acceptable to question the dignity, professionalism and altruism\" of its international medical staff.\\nAccording to a report by the opposition-linked Cuban Prisoners Defenders, based on direct testimony from 46 doctors with experience of overseas medical missions, plus public-source information from statements by 64 other medics:\\nThe BBC made repeated requests for a response from the Cuban government but received no reply. However,  After the Cuban Prisoners Defenders report was published, Cuban President Miguel DÃ\\xadaz-Canel tweeted: \"Once again the empire\\'s lies are trying to discredit Cuba\\'s health cooperation programs with other countries, labelling them as \"modern slavery\" and \"human trafficking\" practices. They are upset about #Cuba\\'s solidarity and example.\"\\nLast December, he offered his support for \"the heroes of Cuban and Latin American medicine\" to mark Latin American Medicine Day. \\n\"To those who fight for life, it is all the same in a modest Cuban neighbourhood or a village in the Amazon. More than doctors, they are guardians of human virtue,\" Cuba\\'s leader tweeted.\\nWhile Dayli at least managed to escape becoming a victim of violence in Venezuela, a compatriot and fellow woman medic was less fortunate. The 48-year-old family doctor wishes to be identified by the pseudonym \"Julia\" to spare her family knowledge of her ordeal.\\nDuring her five-year mission in Venezuela, Julia was stationed in BolÃ\\xadvar state. \"I was unfortunate in that the mission co-ordinator took a shine to me, and I didn\\'t agree to his repulsive insinuations. He had me sent away to a series of out-of-the-way locations in rural areas.\"\\nAt one point, along with another Cuban woman doctor, she was posted to a shack with a clear plastic roof. One day when they saw a door had been forced open, they called the co-ordinator - but Julia says he did nothing.\\nThen, she says, \"I woke up one night, with someone holding my mouth shut. The doctor in the other room was screaming. There were two men in balaclavas, armed with guns.\" Julia says she was raped by both men.\\nThe mission co-ordinator came to take the two women away from this location, but, Julia says, he suffered no apparent consequences or official reprimand for having exposed members of his team to such danger. \\nJulia was taken to Caracas where she was given anti-HIV medicine and sessions with a Cuban psychologist. \"Her treatment was not the best. The focus was basically \\'Don\\'t tell anyone this has happened.\\'\" \\nWhile on a mission in Bolivia, Julia defected across the border into Chile, and now lives in Spain, where she has asked for asylum and works as a surgeon\\'s assistant.\\nMarÃ\\xada (not her real name) is another female Cuban medic who says her gender made her a target. She was a 26-year-old family doctor when she was deployed to Guatemala on her first international mission in 2009. \\nDuring her journey into the state of Alta Verapaz, the mission co-ordinator began telling her about a rich man in the area, whom he referred to as an \"engineer\". Maria says: \"He insinuated that he liked Cuban women.\" She says she was given a mobile phone, on which the \"engineer\" began calling her every day. \\n\"I didn\\'t answer, and I even changed the number, but still he called,\" Maria says. \"The co-ordinator told me I would be sent home as a punishment if I didn\\'t got to see this man, and I said that was fine with me.\\n\"My principles were on the line. I went with the idea of helping poor people on a mission for my country. It was so frustrating - I felt scared but could not run away.\" MarÃ\\xada says that her passport was taken from her by her Cuban minders as soon as she arrived in Guatemala.   \\nAfter two months of resisting pressure to see the man, MarÃ\\xada was switched to another mission. Some months later she heard that the \"engineer\" had been arrested in an army raid, accused of being a drug trafficker. MarÃ\\xada completed two years in Guatemala, and later absconded from her next mission in Brazil by signing up to a US medical parole program, aimed at persuading Cuban doctors to defect. \\nDayli says she and her team in Venezuela had to meet weekly targets set by the Cuban mission leaders  related to the number of lives saved, patients admitted and treatments for certain conditions. \\nShe says she rejected what she considered unethical interference in honest medical care principles: \"That is where my problems began because I wasn\\'t going to lie. If a patient is ready to go home and take medicine orally, I am not going to have them admitted for five days on a drip. I can\\'t say how many heart attack patients I am going to have in a given week.\"\\nAccording to the Prisoners Defenders report, more than half of 46 doctors with experience of overseas missions who were interviewed reported having to falsify statistics - inventing patients, patient visits and pathologies that did not exist. By exaggerating the missions\\' efficacy, the Cuban authorities can, the report says, demand greater levels of payment from the host country, or justify the enlargement of the operation. \\nDayli says the conflict she had with her senior medical colleagues at El Sombrero over the instructions to boost treatment statistics led to her being posted in lower-level destination in the calmer, more rural town of San JosÃ© de Guaribe. But the twin pressures of working without sufficient medical equipment and orders to hit artificial or impossible targets remained.  \\nOnce a woman arrived mid-labour, Dayli recalls, but the clinic did not have the right set of instruments for delivering a baby. Another time, she says she had to inset a tube into a patient by the light of her phone as there was no fuel for the generator.\\nShe alleges her request to transfer a man with lung cancer to Caracas was denied so he would count towards her clinic\\'s statistics. \\n\"The health of Venezuelans is not important to the mission,\" she says. \"I had an 11-year-old die in my arms when I was trying to put him on a breathing apparatus that was not working.\"\\nCarlos MoisÃ©s Ã\\x81vila tells a similar story. The 48-year-old doctor joined one of the first missions in Venezuela in 2004.\\n\"We each had to report a life saved every day, so sometimes I had to grab someone who was healthy and stick them on a drip,\" Carlos says.\\n\"Medicines arrived from Cuba out of date, so we had to destroy and bury them before including them in the inventory as used so they could be charged for. We would get our pay from soldiers, who were sometimes months late in coming, and would also take medicines from the hospital,\" recalls Carlos. \\nCarlos says he signed up for the medical mission to improve his financial situation. Instead of getting around $20 a month in Cuba at that time, he started earning $300 in BriÃ³n, in Venezuela\\'s Miranda province, although he says that the Cuban government was paid more than 10 times that amount for each doctor on the Barrio Adentro programme.\\nDayli says that all fraternising with Venezuelans outside of work was prohibited. The Cuban doctors lived together and had to respect a 6pm curfew. The mission co-ordinator was a Cuban security service official. \\n\"He would ask you about your roommates in weekly interviews,\" Dayli says. \"He had network of paid local informers who would pass on any information about you in order to detect possible deserters. We weren\\'t allowed to have a drink with a Venezuelan, or go to their house because you saved their life and to see how they\\'re doing. If you fraternised with a dissident, you could have your mission revoked.\"\\nCarlos says during the seven years he spent in Venezuela, he saw the way medicine was used as a political tool for propaganda purposes, sometimes at the expense of physicians\\' ethical code. \\n\"During the 2004 campaign for the recall referendum, we doctors were sent out door to door to give out gifts and medicines to boost support for President [Hugo] ChÃ¡vez,\" he says. \"We also had lists of patients according to their political tendencies. ChÃ¡vez regime supporters were put down as having hypertension, while opposition people were listed as diabetics. The former got better treatment, and any information we gathered on locals was passed on to the mission co-ordinator, a Cuban woman who controlled all of our personal relationships and who we were allowed to meet.\"\\nA New York Times report in March quoted Cuban doctors stationed in Venezuela describing how they had worked to persuade patients to vote for the country\\'s ruling Socialist Party, including by refusing treatment for opposition supporters and canvassing on doorsteps with gifts of medicine to bribe waverers. \\nIn response, the Cuban government denied the claims, saying that its \"honourable\" doctors had saved nearly 1.5m lives in Venezuela, as well as citing their participation in the fight against Ebola in Africa and cholera in Haiti, among other examples.   \\nCarlos also made the move from a Brazilian mission to the US, where he is now rebuilding his life in Houston, working as a medical assistant.\\nHe is now unable to visit Cuba for fear of being imprisoned on the island for desertion. In 2018 he applied for a humanitarian visa to visit his mother who had cancer. It was denied, and he could not see her before she died. \"That\\'s the way they play it, dangling permissions and gifts in front of you so people play ball. I soon realised our mission was more political than humanitarian.\"\\nDayli eventually came to a similar conclusion. \\nShe returned to Cuba in 2014 where she was posted to a hospital without an intensive care unit - a clear sign, she says, that she was out of favour. Later she was suspended from medical practice for alleged absences from work - an allegation she rejects. She says she began to be treated as a dissident, with a state security agent posted outside her house who followed her everywhere. Her family and friends were harassed. Eventually, she could take it no more and is currently visiting relatives in Spain, where she may decide to try and settle. \\n\"I wanted to be a doctor in Cuba but I have given that up now. I don\\'t want to be a risk to my family. I spoke my mind and this is the consequence. They want soldiers, not doctors.\"\\nCuba has faced more than 50 years of US sanctions. Now, for the first time, a unique drug developed on the communist island is being tested in New York state. But some American cancer patients are already taking it - by defying the embargo and flying to Havana for treatment.\\nWhy an American went to Cuba for cancer care',\n",
              " 'Glucosamine supplements, better known as a remedy for joint pain, may lower a person\\'s risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), research suggests. \\nThe findings in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) come from nearly half a million people in the UK. \\nAlmost one in five of the 466,039 participants said they took glucosamine. \\nUsers were less likely to develop heart and artery diseases or stroke, or die from these conditions. \\nThe results suggest a possible benefit, but more and longer studies are needed. \\nIt could be that users are generally more healthy, rather than glucosamine having a direct effect, experts caution. \\nGlucosamine is a naturally occurring compound found in joint cartilage.\\nThe body can make its own glucosamine, but supplements are sometimes used by people looking to relieve pain and symptoms of osteoarthritis and other joint disorders. \\nMost glucosamine supplements are sold in pharmacies and health food shops in the UK as a \"food supplement\" and not a medicine. They are checked for food safety to ensure they won\\'t do you any harm, but they are not checked for quality or quantity of the \"active\" ingredient. \\nThe active ingredient can be made synthetically or derived from the shells of shellfish. \\nThe evidence supporting the effectiveness of glucosamine for joint pain is mixed and very limited. Guidelines for the NHS do not recommend it for osteoarthritis. \\nThe new suggested link to a lower risk of cardiovascular disease needs more research. The BMJ study was observational - it can\\'t establish cause. And it did not include detailed information on glucosamine dose or duration of use.\\nGlucosamine was associated with a 9%-22% lower risk of CVD death, coronary heart disease and stroke, compared to non-use over the 10 years of the study.  \\nThe researchers believe the supplement may have an anti-inflammatory effect, which could explain the suggested benefit, but more investigations are needed.\\nStudies on the safety of glucosamine are limited. \\nPeople with an allergy to shellfish should not take it, nor should women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. \\nGlucosamine should be avoided by people taking warfarin, as it may affect blood clotting. \\nIt may also decrease the effectiveness of some anti-cancer drugs, say experts. \\nLike any supplement or medication, it can cause side-effects in some individuals. \\nProf Naveed Sattar, from the University of Glasgow, said: \"Only a trial can determine whether there is any truth to the lower observed risk. Observational studies can only ever generate new ideas to test.  \\n\"Many other supplements have not proven benefits in trials even when observational data suggested there may be health benefits. Some supplements have even been shown to cause harm in trials. So, for now, I would not rush to buy glucosamine to lessen my heart risks when there are many other cost-effective proven ways to do so.\"\\nDr Sonya Babu-Narayan, from the British Heart Foundation, said: \"One in four people in the UK still die from heart and circulatory disease. We urgently need to fund research that could result in improved prevention, diagnosis and treatment. \\n\"If a well-known and widely available supplement like glucosamine could help prevent heart and circulatory diseases, including heart attack and stroke, it is an avenue of research worth exploring.\\n\"Meanwhile, an important way to reduce your risk is to maintain a healthy lifestyle and - when relevant - take medications as recommended to you by your doctor.\"',\n",

It felt like having my hand smashed with a hammer,\" he says.\\n\"My last snakebite would have been a fatal one, but for the fact we were carrying an emergency medical kit so we could do something about it.\" \\nDr Williams, an expert on snakebites at the World Health Organization (WHO) - who travels the world collecting snake venoms to help develop new treatments - says most victims \"don\\'t have that life-saving luxury\".\\nThe WHO calls snakebites \"arguably the world\\'s biggest hidden health crisis\", with one person dying from a bite every four minutes. Hundreds of thousands of others are left seriously disfigured, with many needing amputations. \\nSnakebites mainly affect people living in some of the poorest communities in the poorest parts of Africa, Asia and Latin America. Farmers risk their lives and livelihoods every day while simply tending to their crops, where deadly snakes lurk. Children often become victims too. \\nSo now two major health organisations - the WHO and the UK\\'s Wellcome Trust - are taking steps to tackle snakebites.\\nThe Wellcome Trust is investing Â£80m into a new programme to invest in new treatments and better access to effective anti-venoms. \\nAnd the WHO is preparing to publish a plan to halve the number of deaths and disabilities caused by snakebites by 2030. \\n\"We\\'re at a very important point in the effort to do something about snakebite for some of the poorest people in the world,\" says Dr Williams.\\n\"Many already live in poverty and the consequence of snakebite is that they are driven further into debt and despair, even if they survive.\"\\nSource: World Health Organization\\nSnakebite, though potentially lethal, is treatable. Wellcome\\'s director of science, Prof Mike Turner, says: \"With access to the right anti-venom there is a high chance of survival.\\n\"While people will always be bitten by venomous snakes, there is no reason so many should die.\" \\nDr Philip Price, science lead for snakebites at the Wellcome Trust, says there is a \"spiral of decline\" when it comes to dealing with snakebites.\\n\"The treatments are expensive, the people who need them often can\\'t afford them, and in some cases people can\\'t make it to the hospital in time.\"\\nDr Price said that even when people do reach hospital, sometimes the doctors are not trained adequately, and often treatments are not available.\\nHe said patients may instead turn to traditional healers, meaning they \"fly under the radar\" so \"most countries aren\\'t even aware they have a snakebite problem\". \\nAnti-venom treatment is made in the same way that it has been for more than 100 years. The costly and laborious process sees antibodies harvested from horse blood to make anti-venom.\\nBut even so, it is estimated that the world produces only a third of the anti-venom that it needs. \\nThe horses are given very low doses of snake venom over long periods of time, so it does not harm the animal, says Dr Price.\\n\"Eventually the blood is taken from the horse, and the antibodies are purified out. The antibodies inside that blood then bind and neutralise the venom.\\n\"It\\'s not without risk to inject this directly into the patient.\"\\nThese risks mean victims have to be treated in hospitals, which can take hours or even days for people to travel to. That is often too late to save lives and limbs.\\nAnother major challenge is that many of the anti-venoms available are not actually effective. Different types of snakebites need different types of anti-venom. \\nIn Africa, for example, up to 90% of available anti-venom is thought to be ineffective. \\nThere is currently no authoritative international list that exists of all the anti-venoms available and what they actually treat.\\nDespite the challenges, achieving the WHO goal of halving deaths and disabilities from snakebites over the next decade is \"not all that difficult\", according to Dr Williams. \\nHe has spent decades working on improving snakebite treatments and education, particularly in Papua New Guinea.\\n\"In 2003 in Papua New Guinea, one in every four children who were bitten by snakes died. Today it\\'s less than one in every 50.\" \\nDr Williams says whilst this is still too many deaths, the solution is \"not rocket science\". \\n\"It\\'s about having safe, effective anti-venoms, trained health workers, communities that are engaged in the problem and are taught how better to prevent snakebite, and what to do when someone is bitten.\"\\nHe said a desperately needed spotlight is finally being placed on this avoidable killer. \\nThe WHO will announce its strategy to cut snakebite deaths and disabilities later this month at the annual World Health Assembly in Geneva.',\n",

Her storytelling, however, involves a pre-story prologue before moving to the start of the story, and then wandering through \\'too many details\\', a side-story and losing her train of thought before reaching the end of the tale - and then apologising.\\nHowever, as with all things that hit the internet - once it\\'s let loose, be careful of memes and amendments. \\nDani\\'s diagram was re-versioned by an unknown person who split the flowcharts and created a meme with \\'How a normal person tells a story\\' taking the place of the \\'Non-ADHD Storytelling\\' heading Dani had given her first flowchart, and \\'How I tell a story\\' replacing the \\'ADHD Storytelling\\' heading for the meandering flowchart. \\nThe experience hit a chord and became a viral hit. Actress and writer Mindy Kaling even posted the meme stating \"I feel attacked\". \\nDani says she was a little bit disheartened when the storytelling version with the ADHD element stripped out exploded in the social sphere, as her watermark had been stripped off and the fonts had changed.\\n\"When you\\'re a graphic designer, it just hurts your heart - at least use a good font.\\n\"I had also made a deliberate choice not to water down my images to try to appeal to lots of people, because I wanted people with ADHD to be heard.\" \\nShe said as the image resonated so much, she decided to pull together many more.\\n\"I wanted people to know that this is my experience, this is how ADHD affects me. I\\'m not saying that most people experience this, but it\\'s been nice hearing from people who don\\'t have ADHD but do relate to the pictures, as well as people who have it, or have loved ones who have been diagnosed.\\n\"It\\'s when they go \\'Wow, this really helps me understand it a lot better\\' or \\'Wow, I didn\\'t know we had so much in common.\\' \\n\"I\\'ve had people reach out to me and message me to tell me that when they looked at the whole range of experiences in the series, they related to every single one and sought out a therapist. Some of them got diagnosed and are being treated.\"\\nHowever, Dani is quick to stress that the images are not a diagnostic tool, and shouldn\\'t be considered as such.\\n\"If people ask me, \\'Does this mean I have ADHD?\\' my answer is always going to be \\'No, it definitely doesn\\'t, but if you\\'ve read through the entire body of work and you feel every single thing hits home or if you are crying because you\\'ve got so many different experiences and haven\\'t been understood, then you should think about speaking to a doctor or someone else.\\'\\n\"Being able to have these open conversations, especially in the workplace, is one of the biggest areas where people can struggle. I\\'d like to be able to help with that.  I\\'d like my graphics to help people to understand their children a bit better too.\"\\nDani says one of her biggest fears was showcasing her images to the world: \"The larger the audience gets, the more criticism will happen. I was worried about people saying \\'Everybody\\'s like this, you know - don\\'t blame it on your ADHD\\' or \\'Everybody\\'s a little ADHD and you\\'re lazy or making excuses\\'. People with the diagnosis hear that a lot already. \\n\"But I\\'ve mainly had positive feedback. There are a lot of supportive people out there who are getting involved in the conversation and saying that this is part of a larger body of work - one graphic doesn\\'t tell the whole story.\"\\n All images courtesy of Dani Donovan']"
